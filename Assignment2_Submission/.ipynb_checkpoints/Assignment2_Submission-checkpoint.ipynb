We will build a weighted network, where the weight of an edge is equal to the number of retweets. You can build the network following the steps below (and you should be able to reuse many of the functions you have written as part of the exercises during the previous weeks):"

For each file, use a regular expression to find retweets and to extract the Twitter handle of the user whose content was retweeted. All retweets begin with \"*RT @originalAuthor:*\", where \"*originalAuthor*\" is the handle of the user whose content was retweeted (and the part of the text you want to extract)."
