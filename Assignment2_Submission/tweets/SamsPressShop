Here are some more real life examples for how everyday Americans will benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act...
7)You &amp; your family will be able to continue using the retirement savings option that best suits your needs at each stage of your lives.
6)You will see more “Made in America.”
5)You will be able to more easily start your own business and be your own boss
4) More job opportunities and paycheck growth after years of stagnant wages.
3)You will have an easier time filing your taxes each spring.
2)You will have help raising your children and supporting your family.
1)You will be able to keep more of your hard-earned $$ every month
Here’s what the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would mean for you, your family, &amp; other Americans…
With this tax reform bill, a typical middle income family of four earning $59,000 will receive a $1,182 tax cut.

SSA’s Acting Chief Actuary said they need to be strategic – that a budget alone won’t solve this.
I asked SSA is the new plan is going to stop the cycle &amp; how they can assure us that in 10 yrs we won't have another backlog.
Yet less than 10 years later, here we are again.
Not that long ago, Social Security was facing a different disability backlog &amp; they told us how that backlog was going to be tackled...
I asked SSA’s Acting Chief of Staff why this plan is taking so long.  She mentioned previous problems &amp; that all options were on the table
Under SSA’s plan, ppl still aren’t going to get a timely decision before 2022.
Waiting nearly two years to get a hearing decision is too long!
Social Security needs a Senate-confirmed Commissioner who can lead the agency &amp; focus on providing the service Americans expect &amp; deserve
In February, Ranking Member Larson &amp; I sent a letter to President Trump asking him to nominate a Commissioner w/o delay.
Since ‘13, Social Security has only had an Acting Commissioner.
Social Security needs more than just a plan to fix this – it needs real leadership.  This is in large part a management problem.
Today we are going to hear about how Social Security plans to do just that.  This won’t be easy work, &amp; there is plenty to do.
The SSA must find ways to be more efficient &amp; modernize the Disability Insurance program.
This year, the SSA received an additional $90 million in funding to address the disability backlog.
While some progress has been made, there’s more work to be done. And more $ is NOT the answer…
This is in large part because Social Security continues to rely on outdated criteria to determine eligibility for disability benefits.
