$150 billion ransom paid to release 4 Americans. Expect more hostages to be taken by terrorist regimes.
Obama's response to Iran's detainment of 10 U.S. sailors: $150 billion sanctions-relief payment.  My thoughts: https://t.co/ZOeOal3HMH #tcot
Obama wants the government to fund elections.  Corruption. #SOTU
Honest elections are essential; we must zealously guard against voter fraud. #SOTU
Are Castro's political prisoners languishing in Cuban prisons enjoying Obama's restoration of diplomatic relations? #SOTU
Mr. President, you don't need more war authority. You have what you need, use it! #SOTU
The President has authority to use force against ISIS.  He's attempting to pass the buck to Congress. #SOTU
The President still refuses to say radical Islamic terrorists. #SOTU
Nearly all new U.S. oil production has come from non-federal lands. This Administration has stood in the way. #SOTU
Electricity price increases hit the poor 3x as hard as middle income Americans. Obama's war on coal is a war on the poor and jobs.  #SOTU
President's new economy:  MORE centralized control. #SOTU
I thought premiums would go down by $2,500 for a family of four? #SOTU
The government cannot give anything to anyone without taking it from someone else. #SOTU
Somebody must pay for "no cost" college. Who?  #SOTU
How to encourage innovation? Reduce punitive taxes and government regulations that discourage entrepreneurs. #SOTU
Fair shot at opportunity demands free markets, limited government and the rule of law. #SOTU
Undermining our healthcare system, coal industry and marriage is progress? #SOTU

Norway and Gun Control https://t.co/2S4EiTe5Co #GunsInAmerica
Norway was the site of the world's largest mass killing by a lone gunman. They have very strict gun laws. #GunsInAmerica
"Case by case evaluation" means subjective choice of who needs a license. Corruption. #GunsInAmerica
There is no gun show loophole. A licensed dealer must do a background check wherever he/she sells. #GunsInAmerica
Mr. President, the gun show loop hole does not exist.  All licensed dealers must conduct background checks. #GunsInAmerica
Gun ownership is at an all time high and violent crime has decreased. #GunsInAmerica
Fact: The President’s gun control executive actions would do nothing to stop mass shootings. #GunsInAmerica
Only way to stop executive gun control is to use the power of the purse.  Republicans took that off the table with the Omnibus. #tcot #2A
