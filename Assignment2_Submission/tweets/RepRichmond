This #BillionairesFirst tax plan will do NOTHING to help middle &amp; low-income families in Louisiana. This is why I will continue 2 speak out.
The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has helped 141,000 Louisianans, including 82,000 children. It helps families afford day-to-day expenses
While the wealthiest households in LA will enjoy this tax break, low-income families will see the EITC under attack. #GOPBudget
In 2015, 1,425,290 dependent exemptions were claimed in Louisiana. Proving LA families are in need of personal exemptions.
The #GOPBudget will raise taxes for 235,000 LA families &amp; ELIMINATE personal exemptions which deduct $4,050 for each taxpayer &amp; dependent.
We are still gearing up 2 vote on the #GOPBudget this week &amp; the GOP tax plan won't be good 4 LA families. GOP is putting #BillionairesFirst
