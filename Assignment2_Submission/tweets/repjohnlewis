This spiteful, irresponsible tax cut is not worth the paper on which it is written.
Away from the cameras, Congressional Republicans will quietly begin to cut safety net programs to pay for their massive, corporate tax cut.
After this markup, after the winners pocket their rewards, the spotlight will move on. Every person in this room knows what will happen next
Most importantly, how can you bury your head in the sand when there are grave issues facing our country?
How can you attack immigrant children and DREAMers in a way that is just plain mean and heartless?
How can you target the sick, the elderly, and the disabled?
How can we punish teachers who are just trying to buy supplies for their classrooms?
This tax cut legislation does not make the tax code any simpler or any fairer. This bill is a slap in the face to real people.

Ending Title II Net Neutrality protection is wrong. It is yet another attack on those attempting to bring about the beloved community.
We have seen dark days in our democracy, but the path to a brighter future is paved with the protections of a free and open public dialogue.
We used what we had to bring about a nonviolent revolution in America. And there is another revolution coming.
During the Civil Rights Movement, we didn’t have a website, we didn’t have a cell phone, we didn't even have a fax machine.
We cannot allow a few powerful companies control what you see and do on the Internet.
