Rather than tweeting reckless statements, @realDonaldTrump should spend his Asia trip searching for a diplomatic resolution to this conflict
The Framers chose Congress to be the body that declares war and authorizes military action. This legislation reinforces that intent.
Bipartisan and bicameral, H.R 4140 prevents the expenditure of funds for any kind of first strike against North Korea.
As @realDonaldTrump embarks on his trip to Asia, we want to remind him that he cannot attack North Korea without approval from Congress
It is crucial that Congress reaffirm its constitutional authority over approving any first strike against North Korea.
