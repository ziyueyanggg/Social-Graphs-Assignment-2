Ukraine, and now China. There’s no dodging this. The president sold out our security and values for his own gain.

The evidence is immense and unassailable. He admitted to it.

This is the last chance for my GOP colleagues to choose country over party.

58 people killed.

851 injured.

24 guns.

2 years—and not enough action to save lives.

The victims and families of the #LasVegasShooting must be first in our hearts and prayers today.

The White House just confirmed the #whistleblower’s claim that potentially-incriminating documents were put into a top-secret government computer system.

As we seek to verify the complaint and collect all available evidence, this is yet another corroborated claim.

The President’s illegal scheme is a “profound national security concern,” write hundreds of former national security professionals. https://t.co/Xk4H1qODEl
President Trump is attacking the #Whistleblower’s credibility. But:

- It was internally investigated and found “urgent” and “credible.”

- The White House tried to cover it up.

- It is corroborated by the call log released by the White House.

- The president confessed on TV.
I believe that our representatives in government should work #ForThePeople, not for their own personal interests.

If Senator McConnell agrees, he should allow a vote on our landmark ethics and voting rights legislation, #HR1. https://t.co/w5qsMshlPV

The fact that President Trump mentioned the Attorney General 5 times in his call with Ukraine's president, often in the same breath as Rudy Giuliani, suggests that the president thinks of Barr as another fixer who exists to protect him.

This is not the role of America's top cop. https://t.co/goyMGU9ymj

A question for my GOP colleagues: would you accept foreign interference in your own election? Would you ask for it?

If the answer is no, then you understand that President Trump's actions were corrupt.

If the answer is yes, you're admitting that you would break the law. https://t.co/ITvn2538BN
Take a moment to think about the gravity of what we're facing.

The president betrayed his oath and his office.

He's trying to interfere with our next election.

He's breaking the law.

He's threatening our national security.

That's page one of the #WhistleblowerComplaint. https://t.co/1JbYEvvFBS
Thank you Director Maguire for testifying to @HouseIntel.

But Director Maguire went to President Trump and Attorney General Barr for advice - even though the #WhistleblowerComplaint implicated both of them in criminal abuse of power. https://t.co/1zGQPiVz4t
The #WhistleblowerComplaint implicates both President Trump and Attorney General Barr in a criminal conspiracy.

Yet Director Maguire, when he learned of it, sought guidance from President Trump's White House and AG Barr's Department of Justice.

That's extraordinary. https://t.co/OSqooU8uud
The President suspended U.S. aid to Ukraine. Days later, he engaged in a mob-style shakedown of their president.

When I asked Director Maguire about this today, his answer implied that the call record released yesterday supports the interpretation that the two events are linked. https://t.co/l2yEo3bmkI
President Trump and Rudy Giuliani used another country's dependence on U.S. support to coerce them into helping him in the 2020 election.

Two phrases that will go down in history:

"The President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election." - #Whistleblower, 8/12/2019

"I would like you to do us a favor" - President Trump, 7/25/2019
We now have the #WhistleblowersComplaint. The #Whistleblower was a patriot, who stood by our country, even though it was incredibly difficult to do so.
