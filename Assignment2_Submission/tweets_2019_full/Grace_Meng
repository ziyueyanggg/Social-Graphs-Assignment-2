@RepJayapal @RepChuyGarcia .@repchuygarcia: The #NewDealForNewAmericans upholds our commitment and values as a nation that welcomes immigrants.

@RepJayapal @RepChuyGarcia The #NewDealForNewAmericans would no longer allow deportation of an individual deemed to be a public charge, a ridiculous designation that hurts productive members of our society.
@RepJayapal @RepChuyGarcia It would eliminate burdensome obstacles to obtaining U.S. citizenship. In addition, the legislation would create a system that automatically registers newly naturalized individuals to vote.
@RepJayapal @RepChuyGarcia The #NewDealForNewAmericans would establish a National Office of New Americans to support immigrants &amp; refugees in the U.S. The bill would create grant programs for legal services, English language learning &amp; workforce training initiatives.
@RepJayapal @RepChuyGarcia As the daughter of immigrants, I know the struggles my parents faced when they came to the U.S. As a Representative from Queens – the most diverse place in the nation w/ immigrants from across the globe calling the borough home – I will always fight for our immigrant communities.

Instead, we should be expanding G&amp;T seats in all areas of the city and improve the testing process, so that children in every community can benefit from all that these important programs have to offer. 2/2
Gifted and talented programs in New York City public schools provide students with rigorous and challenging curriculums that help them reach their full potential in the classroom. We should not do away with them. 1/2

As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I was proud to support a provision in the fiscal year 2020 military construction and veterans affairs spending bill that would block the President from using these funds for his wasteful wall. 2/2
.@realDonaldTrump is taking funding away from military construction projects at home &amp; abroad to pay for his senseless, medieval border wall. This will harm our national security &amp; families living on bases. I’d rather invest in our military families, not a wall. Wouldn’t you? 1/2
America must all be counted! Read the op-ed @NitaLowey, @RepJoseSerrano, and I wrote in the in @NYDailyNews calling for proper federal funding for the #2020Census.

Happy #LaborDay! Proud to celebrate America's working men and women and the enormous contributions that the labor movement has made to New York and the nation. As you observe the holiday, please remember the critical role that working people play in helping the U.S. prosper. https://t.co/44v6lc5COX
Great stopping by supermarkets in #RegoPark and #Flushing to talk with constituents about issues that concern them. Thank you to all who took the time to chat. #Queens https://t.co/sVlLrNU1Xs
The House FY20 Homeland Security spending bill would prohibit such transfers and close this loophole, and I urge my Senate colleagues to keep these restrictions in their respective final bill.
I vehemently oppose the Trump administration’s decision to transfer &amp; reprogram DHS funds to expand ICE detention capabilities on the southern border. Trump’s pilfering of money from disaster relief funds to expand his inhumane practices at the border is a gross abuse of power.
I've sent a letter to @amazon CEO Jeff Bezos urging him to remove unsafe, banned and deceptively labeled products, and to implement critical safety reforms, following disturbing reports that items found on the Amazon Marketplace are non-compliant with federal regulations. https://t.co/YzCBK4MEcg
#OTD, women’s equality took a major step forward when the #19amendment-giving women the right to vote-became law. On #WomensEqualityDay, we have much to celebrate &amp; more work to advance women’s equality in areas like equal pay. Proud to support efforts in this fight.
Joined gov't colleagues in urging the @MTA to reconsider its decision to remove all printed bus schedules from bus stops throughout #Queens &amp; the rest of NYC. Move will negatively impact those w/o technology-charged cell phones, seniors, low-income NYers. https://t.co/ROKFTRTkN6
In the correspondence, I also urged the President to convene a global summit to devise solutions to curb the decimation of the Amazon. 2/2
This afternoon, I sent a letter to @realDonaldTrump calling on him to make the #Amazon wildfires a top priority at this weekend’s #G7Summit. Read the full letter below. #PrayforAmazonia #AmazonRainforest 1/2 https://t.co/2cd49ukdz4
I vehemently urge @realDonaldTrump to address this global emergency at the upcoming G7 summit. 3/3
In the midst of this #ClimateCrisis, we cannot afford to lose this critical oxygen resource for our entire planet. This is a travesty of epic proportions, not just for the millions of Indigenous people and species that live in the Amazon, but for the future of all humanity. 2/3
The #Amazon is known as Earth’s lungs. Devastating to see the raging wildfires there. #ClimateChange is the biggest threat to our existence and failing to immediately address this crisis will have catastrophic consequences across the globe. 1/3
With President Trump trying to terminate the agreement, I will redouble my efforts to pass this critical legislation. 3/3
Last month, I introduced the “Stop Cruelty to Migrant Children Act” that among other things, would keep in place the #FloresSettlement, which sets duration and treatment standards for children in detention. 2/3
First @realDonaldTrump separated immigrant children from their parents. Now the President wants to keep innocent migrant kids locked-up indefinitely. This is beyond the pale, and yet another cruel and shameful assault on immigrants. 1/3
.@realDonaldTrump: American Jews are American. Their vote is their choice. Charges of dual loyalties are not “veiled anti-Semitism.” It’s blatant.
Great speaking with constituents this past week at the Bland Houses and Pomonok Houses. Both are NYCHA complexes in my district. Discussed various issues of concern. Thanks to all who stopped by. #Queens https://t.co/hogN17rtTo
Proud to have introduced the Safe from the Start Act that would help prevent gender-based violence affecting women and girls around the world. Our fight and commitment to protecting these vulnerable communities continues. #WHD2019 2/2
Today is #WorldHumanitarianDay where we recognize the aid workers who devote their lives to protecting those fleeing conflict, and victims who flee man-made and natural disasters. There are so many unsung heroes who spend every day working to save lives. 1/2

That is I why I also introduced legislation that would create a grant program for schools and cities to replace water fountains that may have lead. As a #Congressmomma I won’t stop fighting for you and your family. 3/3
But climate change is also having devastating effects at home. In #Queens I’m fighting to improve our local environment to ensure our children have safe drinking water. I believe every child and family deserve access to water free of lead. 2/3
#ClimateChange is a global 🚨 that requires immediate attention and action. Proud to champion a bill that would create a prize competition for technologies that remove carbon dioxide from the air. It’s time to act now. 1/3
Joining @AAFederation and advocates in NYC to oppose President Trump’s #PublicCharge rule. Forcing families to choose between their legal immigration status and basic services is yet another cold-hearted assault on immigrants. We will continue to stand against it! https://t.co/gl1k8SYa1P

80 percent of incarcerated women are moms and women are the fastest growing segment of the incarcerated population. 3/3
Critical that we continue to improve our criminal justice system by providing these needed resources. Initiatives like these help women care for their children and reduce their risk of returning to jail after they re-enter society. Proud to support these important programs. 2/3 https://t.co/ARKcWk8CvT
Visited the Westchester County Jail to observe the Parenting, Prison &amp; Pups program which teaches parenting skills to incarcerated mothers. The initiative is enhanced by animal-assisted therapy in which dogs are used to reduce stress/anxiety &amp; help with mother-child bonding. 1/3 https://t.co/R6Nzsqvhru
Over the last year, I urged the President to not implement this inhumane plan &amp; today I call on him to abandon this reckless effort. Hard working immigrants enrich our communities, contribute to our economy-nation. Can’t allow them to be kicked to the curb by the President. 4/4
Just recently, we witnessed immigrants being targeted &amp; gunned down, &amp; President Trump’s raids separating children from their parents. Now, the President wants to weaponize basic human services to continue his assault against immigrants. 3/4
It will have dire consequences for hundreds of thousands of legal #immigrants, mostly children &amp; families who require critical safety net programs for health care, food and other basic and daily necessities. 2/4
.@realDonaldTrump's #PublicCharge rule is another ruthless &amp; callous attack on immigrant communities. This cruel &amp; un-American plan penalizes those who are in the U.S. legally. 1/4
Deeply concerned that a white supremacist is still employed @StateDept. Hatred, bigotry, and intolerance have no place in our government. How was this person able to get a security clearance, not once, but TWICE? https://t.co/oIHJ1qjiF2

I’m calling on him to pass the Bipartisan Background Checks Act (HR 8) &amp; Enhanced Background Checks Act (HR 1112). Both passed the House in February but have since been blocked by McConnell.

As a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, I will continue to fight for the strongest possible funding for the Coast Guard so that it has the resources it needs to continue its mission and keep the public safe. 3/3
From law enforcement, homeland security and protecting our maritime environment to leading rescue operations and ensuring the safety of boats and vessels, the Coast Guard plays a vital role in making sure our ports and waterways are safe and secure. I thank all who serve. 2/3

The senseless gun violence that plagues our nation is unacceptable. Continuing to send thoughts &amp; prayers after #Dayton, #ElPaso &amp; other tragedies is not enough. The GOP-led Senate must follow the House &amp; immediately pass common sense gun safety legislation. Enough is enough!
Unconscionable for the Trump admin. to end critical programs that seek to reunite #Haitians &amp; #Filipino World War II #veterans in the US with their family members. Further illustrates the President's anti-immigrant agenda &amp; practice of separating families. https://t.co/aRgrYyZYIg
