(4/5) The Court rejected the President‚Äôs spurious claims to the contrary.  This is a very significant development in our effort to hold this lawless President accountable and the administration must now furnish these materials to Congress.
(3/5) The Court further concluded that the grand jury information previously redacted in the Mueller Report and the exhibits and supporting materials referenced in the report are critical to continuing our work and must be provided to Congress.
(2/5) The Court, in a thoughtful decision, recognizes our responsibility to conduct oversight of the executive branch and upholds our full authority to conduct an impeachment inquiry.

Richard Nixon looks better and better with each passing day.
The American people have a right to know what was said on that call with the leader of a country in which the Trump Organization has business interests. This is a sad day for Syrian Kurds and for America.
The President has abandoned our allies in a rash decision following an extended conversation with Turkish President Erdogan.
President Trump has Kurdish blood on his hands. Kurdish forces inside Syria did what Donald Trump was never willing to do, fight with the American military to secure our country‚Äôs safety.

Yesterday, Trump asked China and Ukraine to help smear Biden. He did the same thing on The Phone Call (according to his own transcript) and he‚Äôs going to keep doing this until we stop him.

Next he‚Äôll try and muddy the waters by attacking the whistleblower. Don‚Äôt let him succeed.
The whistleblower is a Democrat. Omg.

The Inspector General is a Trump appointee who found the whistleblower credible. 

So again, when will Republicans stop blindly defending Donald Trump?
So the State Dept told Giuliani that Ukraine was misleading him about Biden?

And then Trump just went ahead and asked them to smear Biden anyway?

How long are Republicans going to keep blindly defending this guy?
