Did you know #WA02 is home to 59,000+ veterans? Next week, I am hosting six forums for veterans to receive updates on legislation affecting them and to get answers to questions about the VA, health care, job training and housing. https://t.co/tyZgw26dCe
Read more about the Rural Veterans Travel Enhancement Act ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/qP08b7QhDV
Vets shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about how to get to their health care appointments, but too often travel is a real burden, especially for vets in rural communities. Today, I joined @MacTXPress to introduce bipartisan leg to help rural vets get to &amp; from their appts more easily.
Yesterday, the House passed the #SAFEBanking Act, a bipartisan bill I cosponsored that applies federal banking laws to legal marijuana businesses in Washington state and across the U.S. to improve public safety, transparency and accountability.
Right now, legitimate cannabis-related businesses in Washington state are often forced to operate on a cash-only basis, harming business and increasing risks.
2 things come to mind after reading whistleblower complaint:

1Ô∏è‚É£l‚Äôm reminded of what Pres Nixon claimed: ‚ÄúWell,when the president does it,that means that it is not illegal." That was wrong then&amp;it‚Äôs wrong now.
2Ô∏è‚É£Rudy Giuliani is the G. Gordon Liddy of 2019.

It‚Äòs time to impeach.
Today‚Äôs hearing is a critical milestone in the Subcommittee‚Äôs oversight work to ensure timely implementation of the law and to address new challenges.
Last year, the Committee wrote comprehensive, bipartisan legisolation to:

üìù Raise the bar on aviation safety

üìùImprove the flying experience for the traveling public

üìùBetter prepare and diversify the aviation workforce

üìùFoster innovation in U.S. airspace

While I am already on the record in support of impeachment, I want to make clear that this behavior is an unacceptable stain on the presidency and also merits President Trump's impeachment.
More recently, the president's tacit admission that he pressured another country to investigate a political rival is a grotesque abuse of the power of the office of president.
In July, I was the first Member from Washington state and one of the first in Congress to support impeaching President Trump, over his utter disrespect for the value of citizenship.

By circumventing Congress, the president is undermining the U.S. commitment to NATO members &amp; treaty allies, all to pay for an ineffective&amp;wasteful border wall. Taxpayers have already paid for these projects once. I will oppose any efforts in Congress to backfill these accounts.
