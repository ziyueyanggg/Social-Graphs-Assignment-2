Much of President Trump’s language and his comments this morning were crude, partisan, or inaccurate. Even after this security success for our country, he couldn’t find it in himself to act like a commander in chief.
Now, we must keep the pressure up on ISIS because the group still has many fighters and sympathizers. This includes making sure we’re guarding against possible reprisal attacks.

We’re ultimately going to win this fight, but we have to do it together. 

Because it’s when our country lets us down the most that we need to work the hardest.
That’s why I’m so proud to represent Massachusetts’ Sixth District in Congress, and also why I ran for president this year—because when my daughter asks me what I did to defeat President Trump and his hateful agenda, I want to be able to tell her that I did everything I could.
Patriotism isn’t hugging the flag, it’s making sure the flag stands for something. 

It’s women marching for basic respect, students walking out for gun reform, and teachers striking for fair pay. 

That’s why we fight today: for our values and for our country.
And we fight to elect Democrats to stand up for patriotism—for taking back that idea from the right-wing politicians who claim to own it.
We fight to elect Democrats to stand up for our democracy. 

In the greatest democracy in the world, we shouldn’t have voter suppression, the filibuster, gerrymandering, or the electoral college to tell people their votes don’t count.
True justice means that we need to start impeachment proceedings for Donald Trump, because neither power nor wealth nor skin color nor office should place anyone above the law.
We fight to elect Democrats to stand up for justice. 

True justice means that we don’t have a racist criminal justice system that kills and imprisons black Americans for doing the same things white Americans do every day.
The right to get the healthcare you need without having to start a GoFundMe account.

The right for women to make their own healthcare decisions about their own bodies with their own doctors, without a male politician or an unworthy Supreme Court justice getting in the way.
We fight to elect Democrats to stand up for basic human rights.

Not the right to carry an AR-15 around; but the right to go to school, or church, or shopping at Walmart and come home in one piece.
In the past few years, Donald Trump and the Republican Party have tried to take us from a country of “yes we can” to a country of “no you can’t.” 

If you’re an immigrant, you can’t dream.

If you’re black, you can’t vote. 

If you’re a woman, you can’t choose.
I think people across America are asking a similar question right now: What does it mean to fight for a country whose leaders let you down? 

The answer today is the same as it was then: we’re fighting to uphold our values that are under attack.
We were right to be asking that question. Because fundamentally, we were fighting in a war that should not have happened—started by leaders who didn’t live up to our values.
The Marines I led in Iraq asked me a lot of questions, from big things like what rocket to use to small things like how to send a postcard to their families. But there was one question that was the hardest: 

“Sir, why the hell are we risking our lives for this?”
I served four combat tours in Iraq—a war I spoke out against—starting as a platoon commander leading part of the first company of Marines into Baghdad in 2003.

This is proof Democrats can win anywhere when we have great candidates who embrace our values and have the courage to have honest, frank conversations about how to meet the challenges we face.
This is a seat that shouldn’t have even been competitive—Donald Trump won by nearly 12 points. Despite Republican attempts to literally steal this seat with ballot fraud, Dan didn’t back down, and he made a safe Republican seat competitive.
Dan McCready has spent the last three years campaigning with strength and dignity. Time and again, he has shown us what true, principled leadership looks like.
Again, national security is where Trump is weakest, so Democrats should be confronting him on it more often.
Mental health is just as important as physical health, but there’s still a stigma around mental health care in our country. We need to do everything we can to ensure people are empowered and able to seek the care they need and deserve. #WorldSuicidePreventionDay

When the threats were reported, law enforcement got an extreme risk protection order from a judge. They served the order. 

The man had 146 guns. He doesn't now.

This is how "red flag" laws are supposed to work. https://t.co/PhQZ2gPqT2
Still true. https://t.co/syKI4gMrJO
Donald Trump claims he's doing good for the economy, but his trade war with China is hurting local business. Small businesses are the backbone of our communities, but the president doesn't care about them because they aren't lining his pockets. https://t.co/4fxtmNl9b1

Mistakes in diagnoses and prescriptions are all too common in the VA. When I went in for an operation, I was told I would get Percocet. Instead, I was sent home with a bottle of Advil. We need stronger accountability. https://t.co/t56L6NV2kC

To win #MSGov, you need to win the popular vote AND a majority of the state’s 122 House districts. Otherwise, the election is decided by a GOP-controlled House.

Laws like this disenfranchise millions, undermine our democracy, and cement minority rule. They need to go.

If President Trump meets with Iranian officials on the sidelines of the G-7, I hope he asks the regime to push Assad to free American journalist and Marine Austin Tice. This would be a promising first step of re-engagement. #AskAboutAustin

The discovery of his racist conversation with Richard Nixon is disturbing, but it isn’t new. Ronald Reagan played racist politics just like Trump; he was just smarter at covering it up.
Reagan’s own domestic policy adviser recently explained “the Republican tax myth” he helped create: Tax cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthy (whites), and don’t actually work. https://t.co/mQklgO5E8E
The AIDS crisis in the U.S. began at the start of Reagan’s presidency, but he refused to take action for years. By the time he finally did in 1987, nearly 23,000 people had died. https://t.co/70GanrXrlw
He opposed policies including the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Fair Housing Act.

It’s possible to support Israel without supporting Netanyahu. Just like it’s possible to support America without supporting Trump.
