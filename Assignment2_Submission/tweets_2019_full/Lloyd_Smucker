(4) I urge them to abandon this partisan bill and collaborate with Republicans on solutions that will work for students and our economy.
(3) However, the Democrats are not satisfied with this important yet passive role. Instead, they want to dictate choice. The policies put forward by the bill today illustrate that Democrats believe the federal government knows what is best for you better than you do.
(2) The role of the federal government in higher education has traditionally been about access. The HEA is supposed to provide everyone that so wishes the opportunity to pursue a college degree or certificate.

The Democrats have made clear that their partisan obstruction agenda of impeaching the President is more important than actually solving the issues the American people elected us to solve.
President Trump has confirmed that he will release on Thursday the complete, full declassified and un-redacted transcript of his phone call with President Zelensky of Ukraine.  Democrats are rushing to impeachment without the facts -- and the facts are currently unclear.
No collusion. So, we should be highly skeptical of the Democrats who are, again, rushing to condemn the President on hearsay and without all the information. For example, we know the whistleblower was not in the room when the call with the President of Ukraine took place.

The American economy is still the strongest economy in the world! Republican Tax Cuts and Policies are working. THIS IS A DYNAMITE REPORT! @HouseGOP @WhiteHouse
At the end of the day, there is no question that @realDonaldTrump and his administration have turned the country around and put it on the right track. Americans are working, Americans are getting paid well, Americans are spending, saving and producing.

3/3 - The fact is, we need to be supporting programs to help American workers gain the skills they need to work in family-sustaining jobs, not passing mandates which will hurt families‚Äô checkbooks.
2/3 - Small businesses will be hurt and employees will lose hours and take-home income with the proposed change. Don‚Äôt take my word for it, see what business leaders and Democrats have said about the proposal. https://t.co/paS0lFrYqo
1/3 - We know that the Democrat‚Äôs proposed minimum wage hike could eliminate nearly 4 million jobs across the country (over 120,000 in Pennsylvania) and real household income would fall by nearly $10 billion‚Äîbecause that‚Äôs what the CBO reported earlier this month. https://t.co/HwJ6m5Qlm3

Took to the floor to honor and give thanks for the great work being done to address the opioid epidemic in PA-11, led in YoCo by DA @DaveSunday and Coroner Pam Gay, and in LanCo by @CommissionerJP &amp; @LGHealth's Alice Yoder. Their efforts are making a big impact. https://t.co/ZXYFVCML4X
3/3 - I hope my colleagues will join me in my efforts rather than pass another purely political talking point that will kill jobs.
2/3- Congress needs to be focused on programs and educational opportunities that lift Americans out of poverty and into great paying family-sustaining jobs. As @EdLaborGOP Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Higher Education &amp; Workforce Investment, I‚Äôm working to do just that.
1/3 -The Congressional Budget Office released a report on the impacts of the Democrats proposed minimum wage hike. As many as 3.7 million jobs would be wiped out and many more employees of small businesses would work less hours. https://t.co/3XAGzvVFjt
