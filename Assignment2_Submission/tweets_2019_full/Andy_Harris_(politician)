I agree, Mr. President. And we should continue to work toward supporting our border, and building a wall to protect national security.

HR 1 will:

-Spread California-style election fraud nationwide 
-Use taxpayer $ to fund partisan campaigns
-Yank voting authority from the states

Needless to say, HR 1 is a disastrous move.
