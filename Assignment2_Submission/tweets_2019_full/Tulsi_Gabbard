Unfortunately, programs to assist these schools are vastly underfunded. My bill will help make sure that necessary resources are prioritized and delivered to schools most in need.
Over 800,000 children of servicemembers attend public schools. Our men and women in uniform, and their families, sacrifice so much in service to our country. They shouldn’t have to worry about the needs of their kids’ schools.

Full disclosure of these facts is not only necessary for these families, it is essential for our national security and to keep the American people safe. The Trump Administration must put the interests of the American people first, and release this information now.
Though Al Qaeda attacked us on 9/11 over 18 years ago, the American people still do not have the truth about Saudi Arabia and who helped Al Qaeda carry out these attacks. The truth is being withheld from the families of those who were killed on 9/11, and from the American people.
Yesterday, I introduced H.Res.662, a resolution that calls on the Federal Government to declassify and release information regarding the September 11, 2001 attacks in order to ensure a full public understanding of what happened and who was involved.

My bill will uphold the #INFTreaty, prevent an escalation of the new Cold War, and protect taxpayer dollars. Rather than scrapping the INF Treaty, we should be working to strengthen &amp; expand it &amp; continue pursuing a path toward security &amp; peace https://t.co/BnNiKxZNgF
President Trump’s actions make the American people and our country less safe, while wasting taxpayer dollars to pay for the new arms race and nuclear weapons -- dollars that should be used to address the needs of our people and communities right here at home.
President Trump’s reckless decision to pull out of the #INFTreaty heightens this threat by exacerbating the new Cold War, sparking a new arms race between the United States and Russia, and bringing us ever closer to a nuclear holocaust.
We face a greater risk of nuclear catastrophe now than ever before in history. The threat of nuclear war is real.
My thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones of the victims of the terrorist attack in Kashmir today. We must stand together to defeat these jihadists and their ideology. https://t.co/PhAfC2vcpr
Thanks to Cathy and Joe from @HawaiiSBDC for the great work they are doing to support small businesses across #Hawaii. Last year alone, they helped 89 business startups, which created 385 jobs, and advised over 1,300 clients, promoting job growth and economic empowerment. https://t.co/TYzioUk9B9
Our legislation will provide the security our working families need to care for their loved ones, without risking their ability to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table.
Without a national family leave policy, millions of Americans are forced to make an impossible choice between their family’s health &amp; financial security.
Across the country, people are working hard every day, living paycheck to paycheck, barely making enough to get by. When a crisis arises, like a parent who falls sick or a personal health crisis, the demands of balancing a job&amp; family needs can be too much https://t.co/d7a87bj6uG
Sending my prayers &amp; aloha to Jackie Young’s ohana and loved ones. I’m honored to have known and worked with Jackie - a true trailblazer &amp; relentless fighter for equality &amp; justice. Her legacy will live on. https://t.co/0y093zYyGx
We must reclaim our constitutional responsibility, and stop supporting Saudi Arabia’s genocidal war in Yemen and strengthening the terrorist groups that threaten us.
US-Saudi coalition has dropped bombs on children in schools, people in markets&amp;families celebrating weddings. They've left millions on the brink of death from famine, disease, starvation&amp; lack of access to clean water&amp;health care, creating the world's worst humanitarian crisis
The United States’ support for #Saudi Arabia’s genocidal war in #Yemen, with no authorization from Congress, has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Yemeni civilians. https://t.co/xCnkV3Kozi
That’s why I’m leading legislation to ensure our service members and veterans get the recognition, care, and services they have earned and deserve.
#BurnPits are the Agent Orange of the post-9/11 generation. I’ve seen firsthand the damage caused by burn pits on my brothers&amp;sisters in arms who survived combat &amp; came home, but are now suffering from cancers, lung diseases, neurological disorders &amp; more https://t.co/cpprA3p0d8
Our Kaha Ki'i Congressional Art Competition is open to all high school students in Hawaiʻi's 2nd Congressional District (grades 9-12). Entries are exhibited in the Hawai'i State Capitol, and winning artwork is displayed in the U.S. Capitol for a year! https://t.co/d5KhvBC5Ys

Sending my heartfelt prayers and aloha to @RepDebDingell and John Dingell’s loved ones for their great loss. John served our country with honor and dignity, and will be greatly missed
Hoʻomaikaʻi to Hiro Toiya, new director of @Oahu_DEM. Keeping people safe during disasters + emergencies is one of government’s most important kuleana. It takes county, state + federal coordination with non-government orgs and community to make sure people are informed and ready. https://t.co/qfOuOXnPbo
Great bipartisan workout with @RepMullin, as always. These friendships matter — they help cut through the partisanship that too often gets in the way of delivering results for those we serve. https://t.co/oQ28zyXJiN
After months of repairs to eruption + earthquake damage, Pāhoa Pool reopened today – a step in returning to life as usual. My team has been on the ground + monitoring the situation since day one &amp; continues to work with recovery efforts to secure federal funding. #PunaStrong https://t.co/6gxAdc7wpb
Ho'omaika'i to Sara King from Ala Wai Elementary in #Honolulu for earning the Milken Educator Award! We are thankful for your tireless service to our community, leading with your heart and aloha for your students and colleagues https://t.co/7gAzVZrUaX
We must bring our troops home from Syria quickly &amp; responsibly. Trump’s announced hasty withdrawal from Syria could leave Kurds vulnerable to slaughter by Turkey’s President Erdogan who has repeatedly threatened to attack them &amp; invade Syrian territory long-held by Syrian Kurds
Ilham Ahmed has been a leader in the battle against ISIS in Syria, where the Kurds have proven to be the most effective ground force, and a strong advocate for peace in Syria. https://t.co/FR30ha7mLI
Many thanks to Disa, Ann, and Desire for serving our Waianae High kids and community, teaching and mentoring our next generation of leaders. Special congrats to Desire who was named a 2019 School Counselor of the Year finalist by @ASCAtweets https://t.co/UDR2x2GprE
It’s a slap in the face to use veterans &amp; their families as political pawns. Our bipartisan legislation will ensure that Gold Star families won’t have to worry about whether or not they'll be able to afford to pay the rent or put food on the table in the event of a govt shutdown
Our veterans put their lives on the line for our country w/ some paying the ultimate price &amp; their families sacrifice greatly. It's our solemn responsibility to honor them, support their families &amp; ensure their families receive the benefits they’ve earned. https://t.co/KhPemlNuqh
We must ensure that our laws &amp; policies strike the appropriate balance: protecting our national security, while simultaneously ensuring the constitutional rights of Americans are upheld.
There are 2 main things of great importance to the American people: our safety and security &amp; our freedom and civil liberties. It’s unfortunate that some leaders in Washington claim the American people must choose between them. This is a false choice. https://t.co/vLtJ6oyNht
This is not about politics. It's about equality. It's about humanity. It's long overdue that we pass the Equal Rights Amendment and include equality between men and women in the United States Constitution. #ERANow
In the past two years, we've inched forward with successful votes in Nevada and Illinois, and now we're just one state away from finally passing the Equal Rights Amendment.
In 1923, the ERA was introduced to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, and was reintroduced every session until it finally passed in 1972. However, because of an arbitrary deadline in 1982, by that time, only 35 states out of the required 38 had ratified the amendment.
There are too many examples in our everyday lives where women still do not get equal pay for equal work and where we still face discrimination simply for being a woman.
It's been nearly 100 years since women fought for and won the right to vote. Yet, we still do not have equal rights and protection under the United States Constitution. https://t.co/QPkMyO5Fat
Read Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's latest e-newsletter for updates on the deal to end the government shutdown, burn pits, bipartisan legislation to address the nationwide nursing shortage, and more.

We cannot allow our government and federal employees to suffer and be held hostage because of partisan politics or policy disagreements.
This deal to reopen the government for 21 days will provide backpay for federal employees, and allow them to go back to work while Democrats &amp; Republicans work together to address funding levels and authorities for border security and immigration concerns. https://t.co/RiAxQ7qyAT
I heard from a federal employee who held a garage sale last week,selling as much as she could to pay her rent. Another in the Army Reserves told me if the govt doesn’t open by February, he’d be forced to volunteer to deploy to Afghanistan for a paycheck to care for his wife&amp; kids
For 33 days, the federal government has failed its citizens. Over 800,000 federal employees have been furloughed or are working without pay. https://t.co/Bf8sIruzki
Our bipartisan legislation will help ensure that nurses in #Hawaii and across the country have the education, training, and support they need to continue their service. https://t.co/wNDfrpWpZE
Too often, nurses are unsung heroes who provide life-saving care to our communities in the most trying times. As our country faces an aging population, increase in chronic diseases, opioid epidemic &amp; more, our healthcare workers must have the support needed to care for our people
I’m honored to join Joaquin’s parents, loved ones and many more who have built this movement to protect our children and help to prevent future tragedies like this. We must take action today, in honor of Joaquin and thousands more lost to gun violence, and protect our communities
The horrific tragedy that occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School left 17 dead, 17 injured &amp; a nation of broken hearts in its wake. Too many parents, like Manuel &amp; Patricia, never knew they were saying their final goodbyes &amp; last hugs &amp; kisses with their sons &amp; daughters https://t.co/rUWuSiKI43
Today, my colleague and fellow veteran, @repbrianmast, and I are reintroducing burn pit legislation, joined by Senator @amyklobuchar and @Sendansullivan, to make sure they get the services they have earned.
In Iraq, the cloud of toxic smoke &amp; fumes from the burn pit in our camp was a daily reality. I know the damage they cause. I've seen the devastating toll taken on my brothers &amp; sisters in arms who survived combat &amp; came home, but now suffer from rare cancers, lung diseases &amp; more
So far, our government has failed to fulfill its responsibility to them &amp; recognize the toxins they have been exposed to -- just like what happened to our Vietnam veterans decades ago when our government ignored their exposure and the ensuing illnesses that came from #AgentOrange
Over 165,000 veterans have registered their names in the voluntary Burn Pit Registry, but there are millions of our troops who've been exposed to these toxic burn pits during their deployment. They deserve recognition. They deserve care &amp; they deserve the services they've earned.
#BurnPits are the Agent Orange of post 9/11 veterans. https://t.co/PSQ5gNRmnI
Senator McConnell and President Trump must pass the House’s bipartisan legislation and re-open the government now. https://t.co/pveG18fvos
Although our nation’s leaders have failed to step up, everyday Americans haven’t hesitated to take this charge, share their aloha, and care for each other. We cannot  allow our people to shoulder the government’s responsibility to function.
Senator McConnell and President Trump continue to put politics before their responsibilities to serve the American people, leaving our working people unable to pay medical bills, afford their rent and mortgage, and put food on the table for their children.
Hundreds of thousands of federal employees across our country are scrambling to make ends meet as a result of this reckless, 26 day-long government  shutdown. https://t.co/qS6q0nshPZ
We passed funding that's sorely-needed by communities like mine, where people are still struggling to get back on their feet w/ limited resources. This bill provides funding for crop insurance, water infrastructure projects, crisis counseling, rebuilding houses &amp; small businesses
But time and again, in #Hawaii and across the country, people have proved their resilience and strength and living aloha, taking care of each other even when they have lost everything.
We were battered by natural disasters of all types last year on nearly all of our islands – from major flooding and landslides on #Kauai and #Oahu in April, an erupting volcano throughout May and June, and flooding and wildfires on multiple islands in August.
In other parts of the country, there were storms and hurricanes that similarly devastated other communities. My home state of #Hawaii was one of them.
