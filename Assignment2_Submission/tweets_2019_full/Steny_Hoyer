It‚Äôs shameful that House Republicans refuse to answer the fundamental question facing our country: is it acceptable for the President to seek foreign interference in U.S. elections for his political gain? As Senator Portman points out, it is not appropriate. https://t.co/mZjlrtJqED
Today, the House is considering legislation to protect @GrandCanyonNPS &amp; other historic #PublicLands from mining. I thank @NRDems for their work to protect these treasured spaces &amp; prevent polluting of these public lands &amp; the Colorado River, which 30 million people rely on. https://t.co/GO0BVXmr2T
Is it right for a president to seek foreign interference for his own personal gain?  The answer is no, and I urge House Republicans to have the courage to speak out and say something about it. https://t.co/GDya331nEJ
It's unacceptable that children are losing health coverage as a result of the POTUS's efforts to sabotage Americans' health care. House Dems passed legislation to protect &amp; expand coverage #ForThePeople, &amp; we continue to urge the Senate to pass our bills. https://t.co/oefYgNKGCo

I told press the House will vote today on a Turkey sanctions bill. Turkey‚Äôs actions in Northern Syria are of great concern to the US &amp; our NATO allies. The House will also vote to recognize the Armenian genocide, an important action to help preclude genocide from occurring again.

Lastly, I told press that I am concerned about the Senate‚Äôs lack of progress on funding the government. The House has done its work and funded 97% of the govt before the end of June. With a month left, I urge Senate GOP to do their work so we can prevent a harmful shutdown.
I also said that POTUS listens more to authoritarian leaders than national security experts, putting our democracy in a dangerous position. That is why the House will pass the Corporate Transparency Act &amp; the SHIELD Act this week to prevent foreign influence in our elections.
At my press conference, I spoke on the passing of my close friend Elijah Cummings. He was admired across our state &amp; respected across the aisle. He advanced the causes of justice, equality, opportunity, &amp; civil rights, and America has lost a great advocate for its democracy.

This is yet another betrayal of those President Trump said he would help; it is the latest of many instances in which he has pushed a major change in policy without heeding input from those who would be most affected.
The Trump Administration‚Äôs proposed rule to undermine the Renewable Fuel Standard program goes back on a pledge POTUS made to increase demand for biofuels. It will harm farmers and rural families who earn their livelihoods through biofuels. https://t.co/fi88NHfFn6
Tomorrow, the House will vote on a bipartisan resolution condemning Trump's decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in the fight against ISIS. His actions represent a betrayal of our allies, undermine our security, and embolden our adversaries. They must be strongly condemned.
I thank Chairman @BobbyScott &amp; @EdLaborCmte Dems for introducing the College Affordability Act today.

The President‚Äôs reckless decisions on Syria ought to be broadly condemned &amp; the House will have an opportunity to join in bipartisan condemnation when it considers Chairman Engel's resolution &amp; his bill to impose sanctions on Turkey. My full statement: https://t.co/LZgrupGNX9
Wishing my friend @RepAOC a happy birthday. Thanks for your dedication to ensuring Americans have greater economic opportunities. Your just society legislative package will spark great conversation about how Congress can address poverty and income inequality.
We expect even bigger savings when the CBO completes its full analysis of the entire bill. This is a big win for patients, consumers, and caregivers. #ForThePeople.
The initial estimate from the nonpartisan @CBO confirms that House Democrats‚Äô bill to #LowerDrugCostsNow will produce dramatic savings on prescription drug costs.  https://t.co/2xpmhexrqG
I strongly agree with a federal judge's ruling that @POTUS‚Äôs national emergency declaration at our border is unlawful &amp; blocking the Admin from stealing money from our troops to fund it. This is a victory for our troops. Dems will continue to oppose this ineffective, costly wall.
I am relieved that a federal judge blocked Trump‚Äôs proposal to make it harder for immigrants seeking a better life in this country to remain here if they receive nutrition assistance, housing vouchers, or other services. This rule was wrong &amp; inconsistent with our values.
Today‚Äôs decision on the Mazars v. Trump Case is a victory for the supremacy of law under our democracy. POTUS may try to hide the facts from Congress and the American people, but the truth will be uncovered. My full statement: https://t.co/lN17AKwlWg

I strongly oppose the President‚Äôs #WarOnWorkingFamilies. House Democrats will continue to work to protect access to anti-poverty programs &amp; services so that more Americans can thrive and Make It In America.
By rolling back access to nutrition assistance, removing protections that stop payday loan lenders from preying on low-income families, &amp; allowing homeless shelters to turn away transgender Americans, the Admin's #WarOnWorkingFamilies makes it harder for Americans to get ahead. https://t.co/B48yDVeZsV
