The #WhistleblowerComplaint should never have been withheld from Congress as required by law. It is deeply disturbing and underscores the need for an impeachment inquiry. #ImpeachTrump
The President of the United States attempted to condition the entire U.S.-Ukraine relationship and forsake our national security for his own personal gain. These acts, if true, constitute a historic abuse of presidential power.
The #WhistleblowerComplaint lays out how @realDonaldTrump didn't just try to pressure the Ukrainian President in a single call. He, his personal attorney @RudyGiuliani &amp; top aides engaged in a months-long pressure campaign. https://t.co/DWCVB3BcSv
