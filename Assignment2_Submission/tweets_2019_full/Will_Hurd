Getting Baghdadi off the chess board is significant. He's responsible for the loss of many lives. This is a great victory for our Special Forces, our intelligence community and our allies.

This is a major victory but the fight is not over. We must continue to work with our allies to hold bad actors accountable, keep ISIS from reemerging and not let up one inch in the fight against terrorism.
Millions were displaced by ISIS reign of terror in Iraq and Syria and tens of thousands were killed, tortured or imprisoned. ISIS attacks in the US and Europe threatened our security and killed many innocents.
Thank you to our U.S. special operations forces, intelligence community and allies for the successful mission to rid the world of ISIS leader al-Baghdadi.
Americans of all backgrounds and faiths should feel safe in their communities, whether they're in their place of worship, at school or at a grocery store. Our nation must continue to stand tall against hate and show the world that only light can conquer darkness. #TreeofLife https://t.co/9lvg3eJWfM

We know there are at least 30,000 ISIS fighters in the region and we know the leader of ISIS is still around. Unfortunately this ceasefire is looking more like a surrender than a peace deal.

Because of this disastrous decision to pull U.S. troops from northern Syria and abandon the Kurds, and all the actions and inactions that led up to this decision, we have let our friends down, hurt our national security and ceded leadership in the region to Russia and Iran. https://t.co/MwQDWJJ2Iq

I‚Äôve taken a conservative message to places that don‚Äôt often hear it. I'm going to say involved in politics to help make sure the Republican Party looks like America.
When I took the oath of office after joining the CIA, I swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all its enemies. I took the same oath on my first day in Congress. This oath doesn‚Äôt have a statute of limitations.
While Congress has a role in these issues, so does the private sector and civil society. After reflecting on how best to help our country address these challenges, I‚Äôm leaving the House of Representatives to help our country in a different way.
We're in a geopolitical competition with China. There is a global race to be the leader in artificial intelligence. We face cyberattacks every day. Extreme poverty, lack of economic opportunity and violence in Central America is placing unbearable pressure on our borders.
I left a job I loved as an undercover officer in the CIA to meet what I believed to be a need for new leadership in Congress on intelligence and national security matters. I wanted to help the Intelligence Community in a different way.

Oftentimes Congress cares more about politics than policy; good policy makes good politics.
Here's a novel concept: Maybe our elected officials should try to be role models to future generations. A first step: don't be anti-Semitic or racist. That way we spend less time rehashing lessons we learned in kindergarten and more time talking about threats facing our nation.
Why did it take several weeks for the Speaker to bring a resolution to the floor condemning the blatantly anti-Semitic comments of one of her members (while refraining from mentioning the member directly in the resolution) and only days for her to do the same for the President?
There is no room in America for racism, sexism, antisemitism, xenophobia and hate. I voted to condemn the President's tweets today but I hope that Speaker Pelosi also considers holding members of her own party accountable to the same degree to which she holds the President.

Understanding and disabling human smuggling and trafficking networks should be a national intelligence priority. Proud to work with fellow former CIA officer @RepSpanberger in a bipartisan effort to dismantle these networks and address the border crisis. https://t.co/THnMDWW6WY
My heart is heavy for the loved ones of Ross Perot as come together to celebrate the extraordinary life of an extraordinary American. He will be sorely missed, but his presence will continue to be felt across our state and nation for future generations. https://t.co/vIfRKnxywT
One of the things I learned in the CIA is when there's not consequences for bad behavior, that behavior is going to continue. That's why we should work with our allies to use our combined economic strength and technical means to prevent Iran from continuing its rogue behavior. https://t.co/XbiJdS3NEn
The lack of trust between Democrats and the executive branch only exacerbates the reality we're dealing with right now.

We can't let the tasteless actions of a few CBP members taint CBP as a whole. The agents I know are heroes who are on the front lines of our border crisis, putting themselves in harm's way each day to save others. Congress must make sure they have the resources to do their jobs. https://t.co/6eQF0FB5AB
Another reason why Congress must condemn the Houthi movement in Yemen for human rights violations, violence against civilians and its ties to Iran. That‚Äôs why @SenTomCotton and I joined forces to introduce resolutions in the House and Senate to do just that. https://t.co/9hyZwxK5ts

When we‚Äôre talking, we‚Äôre not fighting. Engagement with North Korea is the only hope for full denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, but we must remain clear-eyed and continue pressure on this brutal regime until a verifiable agreement is in place.

America is stronger with our allies, and the best way we can protect our shared values and way of life is by remaining united and deterring those who would do us harm.
As we commemorate this day and the sacrifice of thousands of allied troops, remember that peace does not just happen. It must be fought for and earned. D-Day was a critical event that has helped make possible the 70+ years of peace and prosperity by the U.S. and the free world.
75 years ago, the United States and our allies did what many thought was impossible. They successfully launched the largest naval, air and land invasion in human history and began the campaign to liberate continental Europe from Nazi Germany. #DDay75thAnniversary
The way we deal with the humanitarian crisis on our Southern border is not by hurting the 5 million+ American jobs that rely on trade with Mexico and raising the costs of everyday products, from the tank of gas you need to get to work to the cold beer you grab on a hot day. https://t.co/BFjMbxbKnN
BREAKING: CBP apprehended 144,278 people on the border last month, bringing the total this year to 491,975 ‚Äì this is almost the number we saw in all of 2018. We must fix our outdated asylum laws that have been encouraging illegal border crossings. https://t.co/m2qKbHkINQ
