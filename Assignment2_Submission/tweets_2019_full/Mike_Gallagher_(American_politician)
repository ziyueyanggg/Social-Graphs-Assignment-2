Speaker Pelosi's impeachment resolution is an admission that there's been far too little transparency in this process. Ironically, by trying to act more transparent, her last-minute resolution breaks the 72-hour rule intended to make time for real transparency. This is insane.
Great to see @AjitPaiFCC and the administration stepping up to protect American networks from Huawei and ZTE. The security of our communications and the robustness of our supply chain are too important to put in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party. https://t.co/lGPGtPsVj6

In recent years, we’ve found the sweet spot in the Middle East, which I call Hi-Light approach: high impact, light footprint. Working by, with, and through our allies on the ground, we can keep our homeland safe at a minimal cost to the United States.
The raid illustrates the delicate balancing act we need to strike during an era of great power competition. As we shift the majority of our defense resources to deterring China &amp; Russia, we must also continue to relentlessly pursue extremists who want to destroy our way of life.
Baghdadi’s death is great news for America. As the President said, the world is a safer place without him. I’m grateful for our intel community, our special operators, President Trump, and everyone else who made this mission a success.

This is an underappreciated aspect of the current disaster, and one that is likely to echo beyond the region. Just as Putin was emboldened to invade Crimea following the Obama admin’s red line fiasco, I am concerned would-be aggressors will look at Syria and see an opportunity.
Erdogan’s lack of concern over crossing an American redline creates even more of an issue for our credibility and deterrence. If history is any guide, we should expect to see further aggression from bad actors, such as Iran, who seek to test our limits.
The actions taken by Erdogan after receiving the President’s letter only raise further concerns about the collapse of our deterrence credibility. Instead of taking American threats seriously, Erdogan threw the letter in the trash and proceeded with his gruesome operation. https://t.co/KUGXf675Qk

I'm saddened to hear of the passing of Rep. Elijah Cummings. He was a giant in the House of Representatives, and it was an honor to serve with him on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.
This all boils down to the credibility of American deterrence. When deterrence breaks down, conflict is more likely and we lose the ability to dictate the terms of engagement.
If, however, Erdogan was not bluffing, we have even bigger problems because it would mean would-be aggressors do not fear American retaliation. Ask yourself: would Erdogan have felt comfortable risking the lives of 50 Russian service members?
In other words, the presence of American service members has successfully helped deter the Turks from taking this kind of action in the past. It’s unclear why this would have suddenly changed, and it suggests that ultimately, Erdogan was bluffing.
I’m looking forward to hearing from @EsperDoD today, because what we’ve been told so far doesn’t make a lot of sense. Erdogan has been threatening to invade Syria for years now and I’m not sure why we acquiesced after he allegedly gave 48-hours notice.

In April, my colleagues and I signed a letter asking HHS to take actions that support value-based care and lower healthcare costs. Happy to see the Administration do just that by reforming Anti-Kickback Statute and Stark Law. https://t.co/JJFuLJ88ow
The CCP wants to dictate the parameters of acceptable speech worldwide. As Americans, we have an obligation to stand tall in defense of our values. Read my bipartisan letter to the @NBA with @SenSasse, @RepMalinowski, @AOC, @SenTomCotton and colleagues.

https://t.co/GBzoUX4kGp
We're seeing this play out before our very eyes. And things will only become more difficult as the CCP further uses market access to coerce companies to echo the Party line. If we fail to stand up for our values now, we will only have ourselves to blame later.
According to the CCP, “Western people believe that their laws should play the dominant role in friction between China and the West, even in China...they believe their laws are universal.” But as we’ve seen, the reverse is true. The CCP seeks to censor all speech, everywhere.
In just one example, when a German student studying in China made a documentary about human rights abuses, Chinese state media was quick to point out “If...a Chinese student studying in Germany, the Chinese people would accept he must obey German law.” https://t.co/xhs8DhfhyW
As I wrote, the “CCP’s political interference operations—intended to subvert and corrupt key Western institutions—are the least studied, most subtle, and perhaps most important” forms of its aggression. The Party seeks to de-legitimize western institutions like free speech.
In light of what's transpired between China and the @NBA, re-upping my article about the sources of CCP conduct, which highlights the CCP's roots as an influence organization and explains how they are central to understanding the CCP today. https://t.co/otx7yDkmNy
In order to play moneyball in the Middle East, we have to work through local allies. The Kurds have proven themselves to be just that in the fight against ISIS. Abandoning them to the increasingly unstable Erdogan undermines our credibility and national security interests.
Interesting to see the @NBA release a sanitized statement to its US audience while fully parroting CCP talking points on Weibo. So much for its “global social responsibility program that builds on the NBA’s mission of addressing important social issues.”

https://t.co/7F4q4drkCY

This is great news and shows why efforts to curtail the development of intermediate-range capabilities are so misguided. These capabilities are both critical and affordable, and we need them on operational deployment ASAP.

This is an important step to strengthen one of our key international partners. In light of CCP aggression in Hong Kong, it's critical for the United States to stand unquestionably behind our friends in Taiwan. https://t.co/MT1kIMipA9
As I wrote earlier this year in @RealClearWorld, Hong Kong remains a test for the free world. The courage of those fighting for peace and prosperity should inspire us all to help them seize this opportunity for a better future.
https://t.co/ptV5rKHggi
In recent days, the CCP’s brutality has reached a new level. It’s time to impose Magnitsky sanctions on Zhang Xiaoming of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office to ensure the CCP understands it will face direct costs for its actions.

We know that easy-to-understand pricing empowers patients with the information they need to make the best decision for themselves, and I hope Congress passes my bipartisan bill, H.R. 1409, which makes sure you know exactly how much procedures, products and services cost.
Prices are available for nearly everything except healthcare, and I believe it's time we demand transparency from this industry. This will not only increase competition, but as @WILawLiberty proves, will also lower healthcare costs.

I think the only way to justify voting for this budget and suspending the debt ceiling is to pair it with big reforms, like a special commission to look at our overall spending situation. 

If we do it right, I think it can work. I share my thoughts here ➡️ https://t.co/iFlXXBYqsy

Chants like "send her back" are abhorrent. If we are going to get anything done in Congress, we need to find a way to take the temperature down and rediscover common ground. 

I explain my thoughts here ⬇️ https://t.co/S5HT3EpBqM
In short, the @USMC is thinking seriously and creatively about the 21st century battlefield. I hope the other services soon follow. @cdbrose @ElbridgeColby
The guidance also emphasizes we will have to make tradeoffs: “We must continue to seek the affordable and the plentiful at the expense of the exquisite and the few.”
Even better, it emphasizes the importance of ground-based long-range fires to facilitate sea denial and sea control: “We must possess the ability to turn maritime spaces into barriers so we can attack an adversary’s sea lines of communication while defending our own.”
Most prominently, the CPG prioritizes III MEF as its “main focus-of-effort,” and will provide INDOPACOM and 7th Fleet with a “capability to persist inside an adversary’s weapon systems threat range, create a mutually contested space, and facilitate the larger naval campaign.”
It’s no secret that I’ve been critical about DoD’s implementation of the National Defense Strategy. I wrote about this at length in @TWQgw. But after reading the Commandant's Planning Guidance, I'm encouraged the @USMC is taking important steps forward. https://t.co/WdM2hm7D94
Some people get excited to read Game of Thrones, but I nerd out over reading the Commandant's Planning Guidance for the @USMC.

At a time when we have a budgetary disaster, a broken healthcare system, and a crisis at the southern border, Congress should do its job.

There are many shortcomings in this year's NDAA, but one positive has to do with the battle for 5G. Glad the House passed language I worked on with @SenatorRomney to keep Huawei on the entity list, as well as my amendment to ensure ZTE is in compliance with its settlement.

Strong words from retired Vice Chief Sandy Winnefeld on cuts to nuclear modernization: "Counting on the goodwill of Russia to match any preemptive reductions would be foolhardy in the extreme." https://t.co/1Y02gmcTyf
This is a win for freedom, but we cannot take our eye off the ball. The CCP will look for more subtle ways to limit Hong Kong's autonomy.  As I argued at @CSIS last week, we need to combat the CCP by elevating human rights concerns and standing up for Hong Kong and Xinjiang. https://t.co/SYAZF2TLY1
Just like Huawei, we can never fully mitigate the threats posed by DJI equipment. These drones have no place in the U.S. military, and my amendment to this year’s NDAA is about promoting secure alternatives.

Those answering yes to any of these three questions are in a state of denial. If negative trends are not arrested, we may confront an unpleasant choice to escalate to nuclear options or back down in the face of a fait accompli.
1. Can we deny China the ability to conquer Taiwan and dominate the first island chain?
2. Can we deny Russia the ability to seize and hold the Baltics and destabilize NATO?
3. Can we implement the NDS and conduct deterrence by denial vis-à-vis China and Russia?
The National Defense Strategy makes a number of important changes to American defense planning. None is more significant, however, than its shift in the way we deter hostile aggression. As I argue in the new @TWQgw, we must ask three key questions:
https://t.co/IBDCU4B5EB
Preserving the freedoms that remain in Hong Kong is a test for the free world. As I argued in @RealClearWorld, we should help the people of Hong Kong seize a better future, and Congress can start by passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.
https://t.co/ptV5rKHggi https://t.co/mLgVI9xA76
