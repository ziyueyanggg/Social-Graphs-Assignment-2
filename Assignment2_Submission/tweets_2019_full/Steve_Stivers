I'm proud to cosponsor the #PAWS4VetTherapy Act to give our heroes the care they deserve by connecting them with service dogs. We’ve got to do more to provide mental health treatment for those who have served our country. https://t.co/7m5DJgtjc4
Definitely a very good boy. Partnerships between dogs and our military make a huge impact.

Man's best friend also makes a big difference after service. That's why I'm sponsoring the #PAWS4VetTherapy Act - so that veterans can work with dogs to treat PTS.

There are many things that make me proud to be an Ohioan, but our infant mortality rate is not one of them. Proud to cosponsor the Healthy Start Reauthorization to ensure kids in Ohio and across the country get a healthy start in life. https://t.co/SuN4VLIwAX
In addition to bringing new perspectives to our classrooms, international students have an economic impact. In #OH15, they contributed over $48M to our economy &amp; created 500+ jobs. Earlier this year, I offered remarks in the House on this issue. Read here: https://t.co/CjkLqlkAV3 https://t.co/CdHjzck7up
Congress needs to pass the #USMCAnow to support the #OH15 farmers who make a real impact in strengthening our local economy. This is one of the best tools at the federal level to give our agriculture community the certainty they need to thrive. https://t.co/C9Q22nAisk
#tbt to a roundtable with female business owners earlier this year. https://t.co/90NypPywZy
#WomenInBusinessWeek is a great opportunity to highlight the impact businesswomen have on our economy. 11.6 million female-owned businesses generate $1.7 trillion in sales. Women in #OH15 and across the country are creating jobs that have led unemployment to drop to record lows.
Thank you to each local chamber of commerce across #OH15 for supporting our local economies. By providing crucial resources, you help entrepreneurs and business owners to continue reach their full potential. #SupportYourLocalChamber https://t.co/eeWQygXjOd
As we approach Veterans Day, we remember all of the tremendous sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform for this great nation. 

Is there an inspiring veteran in your life? I would love to hear their story. More here: https://t.co/D11G7jkU8S https://t.co/UIFwgal5YO
JUST NOW: I voted in favor of HJRes 77, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, opposing the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Northern Syria. The chaos and violence that has resulted from this misguided decision is no way to repay our partners in the fight against ISIS.
Only 42% of US adults have a budget and keep track of their spending. Improving financial literacy can make a big difference. I co-chair the Financial Literacy Caucus to get you the tools to make informed financial decisions. More: https://t.co/DOAKOy8aR9 #FinancialPlanningMonth https://t.co/w9VRLQDOZ7

It was great to visit Heidelberg Distributing in #Columbus, a family owned and operated company dedicated to excellence for over 80 years now. Thank you for being a partner in growing our local economy. https://t.co/5eJ2Nk23lq
This could increase the flow of refugees into neighboring countries and create power vacuum that could allow ISIS to regroup.
It is now clear that the presence of U.S. troops was a stabilizing force in Northern Syria. Within two days of the withdrawal of U.S. troops, Turkish forces have read this decision as an invitation to launch offensive operations against our partners, the Kurdish forces.
As #YomKippur begins, I hope that all those reflecting during this time experience a meaningful holiday. G'Mar Chatima Tova. https://t.co/bZmbId794J
The Military Celebration at the Fairfield Co. Fair was a much-needed event to thank those who’ve served our nation for their leadership, selfless service, and patriotism. It was an honor to celebrate their service that provides all Americans the freedoms to achieve their goals. https://t.co/Bysz2RNCKm
We cannot allow our national security and our partnerships in the region to be undermined and I encourage the Trump Administration to reverse this decision immediately.
Withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria abandons our allies and benefits only the Assad regime and its backers – Iran and Russia. This move threatens to undercut the hard-won American victories against ISIS.
I toured the Rickenbacker Intermodal area in Pickaway Co., to see how companies such as Amazon and Delong Company are adding jobs, helping farmers, and providing capital investment for #OH15. I am proud to have led the TIGER Grant, which helped in developing the area. https://t.co/cG9xOruCzQ

Man’s best friend has always had a special partnership with our men and women in uniform. At the @AmericanHumane’s K-9 Medal of Courage Awards, I shared the story of #OH15’s Ed and his partner, Prince. The two served in Vietnam and saved thousands of lives together. https://t.co/060WmdAlSX
Agriculture is vital to our community - farming provides nearly 1 out of every 8 jobs in #Ohio.

The divisive rhetoric and personal attacks we’ve seen from the President and Members of the House over the weekend are unacceptable and stand directly in the way of progress.
The constituents we represent sent us to Washington with a job to do – maintain our economic growth, fix our immigration system, and look out for our veterans, to start. Swapping insults on the Internet makes our jobs that much harder.

Every #MemorialDay, communities and families come together, spending time remembering and honoring the brave men and women who paved the way for freedom. We will #NeverForget those who dedicated their lives to serving their nation, they left a legacy for us now to live up to.
Began #MemorialDayWeekend at Greenlawn Cemetery, paying tribute to Union soldiers who gave their lives in the Civil War.

They put their lives &amp; the lives of their families on the line to advance America’s security.

In Ohio, #infrastructure is critically important. From repairs to SR 376 in Morgan County, to improvements to Rickenbacker International Airport, investment in infrastructure is an investment in our communities.
Today is #DecencyDay. Whether you are in the halls of Congress, or the halls of your school, acting with #civility and decency is incredibly important. Today, and every day, let’s remember that we can disagree without being disagreeable. https://t.co/0CJd8TUVIz

Let's continue to show support for all military spouses who inspire and support our troops daily. #MilitarySpouseAppreciationDay https://t.co/SPAJRa53L0
These mothers have been apart from their children for years, missing too many milestones while working to support them from thousands of miles away. You don’t have to be a parent to understand their heartbreak.

Grateful to join @the_USO today to assemble care packages for deployed service members. Since 2003, they have delivered more than 2.6 million. Having received one myself during deployment, I know how much these mean to soldiers. https://t.co/iM3Uh03XRn
...but we cannot allow extremism and Anti-Semitism to fester within our communities and we all must work to drive out hate and persecution.”

Great news for Morgan Co. → $4.5 million grant was awarded to repair SR 376 in #OH15. Proud to partner with local officials on this problem. The closure is more than an inconvenience to residents, it hinders access to schools and essential services. More: https://t.co/RmbNCE1YN4
We stand with the people of Christchurch.
What happened in New Zealand was despicable and an act of terrorism and prejudice that has no place in our world. Freedom of religion is a cornerstone of any democracy, and we cannot allow the hatred of a few to destroy the principles we hold dear.
