It was a pleasure to speak at the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission today. As you can see by watching the clip below, we discussed the importance of speaking out against religious persecution around the globe. https://t.co/gHwktKcjLg
The USA , entire free world, and my colleagues in the U.S. Congress will be watching closely.
I support their demand for a Civilan led government formed by the FFC and Sudanese Professional Association.  The Transitional Military Counsel must refrain from any use of force against the peaceful Million Man March on June 30th.
It has been over 3 months since my visit to Sudan. The people spoke to me then and they are speaking now. They demand a democratically elected government that will follow the rule of law and honor basic human and civil rights.

ICYMI- We must help our wounded Vets, like Captain Kules, by expanding this vital program.  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.

I was proud to support this effort to help preserve this historic landmark in our community.

I look forward to meeting with Hope and her family later this week. I have and will continue to fight to ensure children with complex medical conditions have access to quality care and to protect access to care for persons with pre-existing conditions.

I will continue to work on a bipartisan basis to protect Florida's coastline.

We must protect Veterans who are negatively impacted when their school closes. They should be held harmless and their GI bill benefits should be restored. This was the subject of our VA Economic Opportunity Subcommittee hearing this morning. https://t.co/QdYjcyB1IE
Thousands of my constituents just joined my teletown hall.  We discussed the crisis at southern border, VA, debt, COLA, mental health, addiction and the high cost of Rx drugs.  Special thanks to everyone who took the time to participate.  You help me be a better Congressman. https://t.co/QyWmdg7u1j
Service animals have helped countless Veterans manage mental health related conditions. I have authored legislation which would expand access to service animals for those who are suffering. https://t.co/SK2mWLp2g0
I am a proud co-sponsor of the Protecting Home Oxygen &amp; Medical Equipment Access Act. It will protect seniors by preserving access to durable medical equipment (DME) by addressing severe cuts to reimbursement rates for oxygen concentrators.
We must remove barriers that exist in ensuring that Veterans at risk for suicide get the help they need.  As noted in this study, only 6 of the 22 Vets that commit suicide daily are connected with VA. Improving outreach is a necessity.   https://t.co/7XJOsHuN5T
When it comes to dealing with an issue as sensitive as the mental health needs of our nation‚Äôs heroes, we should allow access to any treatment that shows promise.   https://t.co/eDaWMXAKGn
As part of removing the stigma for treating mental illness, we must ensure mental health needs are recognized as legitimate healthcare issues. One way is enforcing parity laws.  I'm proud to work with my colleague on this important issue.  @RepKatiePorter

Traffic is such a huge concern in our community.  It is great to learn about ongoing efforts to alleviate congestion and improve safety.  https://t.co/KppqmULNNY
It is wonderful to see these groups joining forces to fight for Vets exposed to toxins during their service.  I look forward to working with them. A special thank you to our own Lauren Price for helping to spearhead this joint nationwide initiative.  https://t.co/OASAxTiYHV
Even the New York Times understands that we have a crisis on the border that requires immediate attention.  House leadership must stop playing political games.  We need to work together to provide funding to solve this humanitarian crisis.  https://t.co/FADABoHLKq
I strongly condemn the use of force by TMC and the continuing killing of innocent people by the Janjaweed  forces in Sudan.
I strongly urge the TMC to expedite the power transfer to Civilian Government without any delay or further bloodshed.
I encourge UAE/Saudia Arabia and Egypt not to meddle in the process of power transfer to a civilan government. We are watching closely.

A few years ago I secured additional funding to build a new VA clinic in NPR, which will be more than 2x the size of the current one.  It will be a great addition to our community, offering enhanced programs and services for our heroes. https://t.co/SkiUr5txea
What an honor to stand beside my father at this morning's groundbreaking ceremony for the new, expanded VA clinic in New Port Richey.  When he represented this community in Congress, he fought for the seed money to open an outpatient clinic in West Pasco. https://t.co/0yMLQt3VNM
I proud supported the MISSION Act, signed into law 1 yr ago. VA has now launched a patient-centered system of care that empowers Vets, removes red tape, and ensures heroes have timely access to individualized care. I'll continue to monitor implementation.  https://t.co/eEpHPHkF6w
Today, we commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day. The brave patriots who stormed the beaches of Normandy altered the course of history and saved countless lives from oppression, genocide and tyranny. They're truly a part of the Greatest Generation! #DDay75thAnniversary https://t.co/0X9GtSSFGM
As we approach full implementation of the Mission Act, this information may be helpful to Veterans as they seek to learn how to access the care they need.

@GIBillRights @HouseVetAffairs Advocating for our Veterans is my privilege.  Thank you for your advocacy!
Last night, I voted for the emergency funding package which provides necessary relief to those suffering from natural disasters. It is now headed to the President.  The bill also extends NFIP until 9/30/19 which is vital for our local housing market. https://t.co/JZHoaWtPDD

We must make sure all Veterans have access to whatever treatments they need to address their mental health needs.  The COVER Act legislation I wrote which was signed into law in 2016 is helping to make that a reality.   https://t.co/IB2N3F0Ezj
We must support the Sudanese people in their efforts to transition to a government that supports the rule of law and is committed to protecting basic human rights for its people.
It is crucial that the U.S. and our allies condemn the unlawful killing of peaceful protestors by the Transitional Military Council in Sudan.
