Facts matter. And in my opinion, the facts released to date don’t justify impeachment.
As promised &amp; in the interest of transparency, @POTUS released the transcript of his phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky. After reading the transcript for myself, I don’t think it warrants the grounds for impeachment that Democrats prematurely claimed ahead of release.

I will neither participate in nor support efforts that use the tools of the House as a one-sided weapon to punish the president while ignoring the reckless rhetoric of so many of his Democratic critics. My full statement on H. Res. 489 ⬇️ https://t.co/qzPcAEkkzl
Americans who have different opinions are not racists. They are just Americans who have different opinions. Let’s respect one another more, disparage one another less and heal our land.
It is time to dial down the rhetoric on both sides and restore civility to the House floor and our national dialogue.
The result? Speaker Pelosi’s remarks of the floor were ruled out of order this afternoon, and the House was plunged into chaos.
In Rules Committee last night, I warned that if Democrats proceeded with their reckless resolution, it would be like "throwing gasoline on the fire." They went ahead anyway.

To tackle our nation's burden of debt, tough decisions and careful solutions are required. But the solutions must include reforms to save and sustain the mandatory programs serving many vulnerable Americans.
The federal government does not have a revenue problem, it has a mandatory spending problem. In 1965, mandatory accounted for 34% of the budget. Last year, it made up more than two-thirds. By 2028, that figure is projected to reach 77%. https://t.co/aHcK2r17e2
