Only though science can we truly understand the scale &amp; urgency of the growing #ClimateCrisis. https://t.co/fzksE3wHm2
@ClimateCrisis @USRepKCastor @ArcticPermafrst Hard to overstate the impact here. At the low end, this means Arctic permafrost melt could be adding the equivalent of the entire emissions of New York State to the atmosphere, every year until 2100. Hundreds of millions of cars worth of carbon. We must #ActOnClimate now. https://t.co/rjUrqekgro
@ClimateCrisis @USRepKCastor @ArcticPermafrst These new Winter Arctic emissions are a new discovery being tracked by these researchers. That means these are emissions that have not been factored into IPCC and other global climate projections so far. https://t.co/rsc2zMUPZk
@ClimateCrisis @USRepKCastor @ArcticPermafrst This powerful research shows us that warming permafrost is now causing increased microbial activity in the WINTER, a new development that is dramatically increasing emissions. This could mean the release of up to 27 BILLION TONS of carbon into the atmosphere by 2100. https://t.co/M3C1jryMpH
@ClimateCrisis @USRepKCastor @ArcticPermafrst Releasing that carbon will significantly increase the total greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere, which will further warm the Earth, thaw more permafrost, release more carbon, and on and on. https://t.co/IhQkr4twCk
@ClimateCrisis @USRepKCastor @ArcticPermafrst Right now, there is 2x as much readily-available carbon in cold and frozen arctic soils (a.k.a. permafrost) as there is in the entire Earth‚Äôs atmosphere.

Each of the 20 were special. Let their names and stories fill our voices today, and let their memories be forever part of who we are and guide us for another year. 

May they Rest In Peace.
To stand with families and friends who have lost immeasurably, to grieve with them, to struggle with them, to try again to pick up the shattered pieces of ourselves in a shared, soulful remembrance.
The first anniversary of any tragedy brings a painful renewal of grief and loss. In these times, even if we think there is nothing more we can say, we come together to remember, to hug, to tell stories and shed tears. And so today our communities gather together once more.
Their faces and voices that night of the first vigil have stayed with me. Thousands had converged to remember the lost, to stand with their friends and loved ones in painful solidarity, to grieve together.
Today marks one year since the fateful October afternoon when 20 souls, beloved by their families, friends &amp; communities, were lost in a terrible limousine crash in Schoharie, New York. 

For a year their loved ones have carried the weight of an unfathomable anguish.

Once again, the Trump Administration is ignoring climate science and evidence of the devastation already occurring in our communities. This move to block states from being able to #ActOnClimate is reckless climate denial of a kind we can no longer afford.
Worst of all, this drags us backwards on the #climatecrisis! Transportation is the leading source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and light-duty vehicles account for nearly 60% of those emissions!
All of this helps explain why numerous automakers have come out strongly against the Trump Administration‚Äôs proposal and in support of meaningful, predictable year-over-year increases to this powerful standard: https://t.co/3Of7ZU3ILx
As we stand still, other nations continue to race forward to develop the next generation of innovative vehicle technologies, virtually guaranteeing future jobs, investments and even new industry creation will happen beyond America's shores.
This Administration has also pushed to undo future federal clean car standards, even though their own analysis shows this bizarre move will result in significantly more pollution and domestic job loss.
This misguided move throws it to the courts, triggering years of uncertainty for America's auto industry. Over and over we have heard this Administration pay lip service to cooperative federalism; apparently that only applies to states advancing their extreme deregulation agenda.
Let's be clear: the President has no legal process or justification for revoking this waiver. The Clean Air Act gives California a right to seek it and other states, including New York, have the right to adopt their strong standards.
Add these to your list of false claims by President Trump. CA clean car standards have been great for U.S. consumers, our country and planet. This revocation defies the rights of states including New York to protect our citizens. It has no basis in law, economics or common sense. https://t.co/28wx2d9NmA
