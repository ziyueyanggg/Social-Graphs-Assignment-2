As a member of @HouseIntelComm, I look forward to reviewing this report and working towards making this information public as soon as possible.
This exhaustive report came to the same conclusion that the @HouseIntelComm arrived at: "The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."
Thank you @POTUS for your strong support of our military and #OH jobs!
As Chairman of House Armed Services Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land, I authorized millions of $ in @USArmy upgrades on hundreds of M1 Abrams tanks. We kept the Lima plant open.

I stand in strong support of continued and increased pressure on the Kremlin to hold Vladimir Putin accountable for his reprehensible actions. https://t.co/smhnZpmjPt
In recent years, we have seen the Russian annexation of Crimea; the Kremlin’s murder and attempted murders of Russian citizens for speaking out against Putin; and Russia’s continued interference in democratic elections, including here in the United States.
As a former President of NATO Parliamentary Assembly, I have witnessed rapidly increasing Russian aggression.

.@SecAFOfficial Heather Wilson is a dear friend and former colleague of mine. The importance of her incredible work in @usairforce cannot be overstated. It is not surprising to me that Heather would be sought out by other organizations looking for her strong leadership.
This level of coaching of a witness is highly unprofessional and inappropriate, and any claim to the contrary is complete nonsense.

As I have voiced to this Administration repeatedly, I strongly believe securing our border should not be done at the expense of previously funded military construction projects.
However, I believe it is a dangerous precedent for the President to be forced to declare a national emergency because Congress refuses to provide necessary funding to protect our country.
I supported this funding deal as a step towards securing our border, which we absolutely must do.
