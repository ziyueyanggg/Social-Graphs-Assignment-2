I‚Äôm proud to lead the Healthcare Innovation Caucus, which is promoting  more innovation and more access to care.
Very cool work being done, including:   New software to help understand medical procedure pricing, new technologies to monitor heart health - from your bed, board games that help kids cope with major surgeries, and apps that let you refill prescriptions just by taking a picture!
I‚Äôm here at the #InnovationShowcase at the Capitol, checking out the great work happening at the intersection of medical and digital innovation.
Great to see Judge Ramona Gonzalez from La Crosse in D.C. as she testifies for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.

This isn't winning - this trade war is a net loss for America's farmers, workers &amp; families.

ICYMI: Last week, I introduced a bill that would give Wisconsin medical residents more opportunities to learn and work in community hospitals across our state. Read more here: https://t.co/A8glns5RR2
301 Tariffs are hurting the bottom-line of Wisconsin businesses, their workers, and consumers. If the Administration won't make an exclusion process, Congress will. 
Today, I introduced a bipartisan, bicameral bill that will do just that: https://t.co/0A0M8Rgblo
Today, the @WaysMeansCmte held a hearing on the U.S.-China Trade Relationship. I spoke about why Wisconsinites need this Admin to lift the tariffs and stop taking a unilateral approach to dealing with bad actors. See more here: https://t.co/UWMlPyQgjQ
‚úÖ Outdoor recreation is an important part of the Wisconsin way of life. I'm glad that the #PublicLands package passed and that we'll now have the resources and tools we need to protect our land and pass on our traditions to the next generation. https://t.co/xiEdlqK7Bb
...and who's losing the trade war? America's workers, farmers and families. https://t.co/HU0i6YA3h8
Proud to partner with @RepGallagher to introduce a new bipartisan bill that will help provide more opportunity for medical residencies here in Wisconsin, and ensure our rural communities have the medical professionals they need to stay healthy and strong. https://t.co/LvHXFRNh2w
Bipartisan bills like this help us pass on Wisconsin‚Äôs outdoor traditions, and ensure the next generation has the opportunity to enjoy all that #Wisconsin has to offer for years to come.  https://t.co/3NKz5vCbqB
1/2 - Later today, we‚Äôll vote on a sweeping #PublicLands package that reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund #LWCF, protects land for hunting and fishing, and creates new wilderness across the country. üèîÔ∏è

Great to meet with student leaders from @UWEauClaire earlier this week. We talked about the important issues facing the next generation of Wisconsinites, and how we can help our students earn a better life by lowering student loan debt and increasing opportunity. https://t.co/D94i0xcxib
The President‚Äôs emergency declaration is distracting Congress from the important issues Wisconsinites care about, and is a gross overreach by one branch of our government. Plain and simple: this isn‚Äôt the way it should be done. https://t.co/QJ8ab98cGm
Great to stop by Lazy Monk Brewing in Eau Claire today to talk about a new bill I introduced last week that will give our small and craft brewers a fair shot. Cheers to Wisconsin beer! https://t.co/J9oIIWi2rk
Thank you to all of our volunteers who battle the Wisconsin winters to keep our fellow Wisconsinites from missing a meal! https://t.co/audhmlATiu
Taking action on gun violence and being respectful about Second Amendment rights are not mutually exclusive. Only by working together on this can we prevent these mass shootings from happening. | 2/2
Today, we remember the lives lost in the horrific Parkland shooting. 
Gun violence cannot be our new normal. 
It's time to move forward on commonsense gun safety measures in this new Congress, and protect our children and families. | 1/2
This isn't sustainable, and this isn't fair to the next generation. Our kids and grandkids are going to be paying the price for Washington's fiscal irresponsibility for years to come.
https://t.co/ZypKtA2BQW
Today, I introduced a bill that will help grow WI craft breweries by reducing tax burdens and restrictive regulations for our brewers. Easier business leads to even more good-paying, meaningful jobs here in WI. We can all cheers to that! üçª

Yet again, Wisconsinites will be on the hook for the President's trade war. https://t.co/BGbKrvq2Mq
John‚Äôs wise words stuck with me, and I‚Äôve passed his advice along as I mentor new Members here in the House. His wit and wisdom will be missed.
I‚Äôll never forget what John said: You have an important job, but you‚Äôre not an important person. The minute you think you are is the minute you cut corners.
When I first came to Congress, John Dingell was one of the first people I sought out for advice.
Tawni and I are saddened to hear about the passing of former Rep. John Dingell.
John challenged all of us to come together to make life better for all Americans. His positive attitude will be missed.
Our prayers go to Debbie, the Dingell family and our Michigan neighbors tonight.
Great to be on Central Time talking about the issues facing Wisconsinites in rural communities! Listen to the interview here: https://t.co/cCpqusecdH https://t.co/4qHO2X2Ys8
Proud to lead a bipartisan, bicameral team in introducing the Trade Security Act of 2019. It is long-past time for Congress to reassert its constitutionally-granted power in our Nation‚Äôs #trade policy and protect our export power. Read more here: https://t.co/lZiezr0V0s
We have a problem when it comes to retirement savings. I am proud to introduce the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act, which l will help Wisconsinites grow savings accounts and help us avoid a retirement savings shortfall in the future. #RESA https://t.co/lwYkmdV7BD
3/3 I stand ready to work with all of my colleagues to find common ground, and will fight to break down the hyper-partisanship in Congress to make life better for Wisconsinites. There is far more that brings us together than divides us.
2/3 We don‚Äôt need a Republican or Democratic agenda ‚Äì we need an American agenda. I was encouraged to hear bipartisan proposals in tonight‚Äôs #SOTU, including a commitment to lowering drug prices, rebuilding our failing infrastructure, and investing in cancer research.
1/3 We can all agree: America needs unity.
Wisconsinites like Ramon are the heart of our rural communities. It is an honor to invite him as a tribute to our first responders and volunteers who work tirelessly to lift our communities higher and move us forward.
I look forward to Ramon Knudtson joining me for the #SOTU. Ramon has dedicated his life to making Wisconsin stronger through his work with the Village of Melrose, the Wisconsin Rural Water Association, and the Melrose Fire Department.
Great to join Scott and Elizabeth at the @LaCrosseTribune for Tribcast, the Tribune's podcast. We talked about the State of the Union, what Washington is up to this week, and the path forward in the 116th Congress. Check it out here üëá https://t.co/SuNC8e74aF
Check out this feel-good story from La Crosse. Thanks to all of the teachers, support staff and administrators who work every day to ensure our kids learn the important things: "be respectful, responsible and safe." https://t.co/UNzzOV8eiR
Proud to introduce the bipartisan, Bicameral Congressional Trade Authority Act. Congress needs to stand up and fight for our rural economies by taking back the trade authorities that, according to our Constitution, clearly belong to the Legislative branch. https://t.co/0RVB1Xzlkz
Foxconn has a bad track record of breaking promises, and now it's clear that Wisconsin's taxpayers are the ones getting fleeced.

The fight to protect Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions is always personal, because it touches so many of our lives.

This shutdown cost us $3 Billion, and we'll never get it back. Shutdowns have consequences long after they end, and should NEVER be a negotiating tactic. https://t.co/0XHMRyvx22
2/2 Now it‚Äôs time to get in the same room and work together to find commonsense, bipartisan solutions that effectively fix our broken immigration system.
1/2 Reopening the government is the right first step to moving forward from this embarrassing shutdown - but this short-term compromise bill cannot lead to another shutdown.  The federal government and its workers should never be used by anyone as hostages for a policy goal.
Wisconsin farmers, workers and families can't afford more tariffs, and are suffering the consequences of this trade war. This bill - and the administration's bad trade policy - will hurt our rural economy and America's heartland. https://t.co/mNxSvKVjNo
Wilbur Ross, who spent a decade reporting a nearly $3 BILLION net worth, doesn't understand why Wisconsin's federal workers &amp; contractors, farmers, and families can't afford this shutdown. Talk about out of touch. https://t.co/FNPglrrxzE
In Case You Missed It: Yesterday, I unveiled my plan to reopen the federal government. Check it out here: https://t.co/fUA6YxH6EU
It‚Äôs time we create a pathway to citizenship that funds border modernization and stops the inflow of drugs into our country, while promoting the legal immigration that Wisconsin‚Äôs farmers, businesses and communities need. Read more here: https://t.co/4EHSSV1qrK
There is no question that our immigration system is broken and badly in need of repair. Instead of refusing to work together, I‚Äôm proposing a compromise: commonsense solutions to the problems that we face, and at no cost to Wisconsinites. https://t.co/qyg9fLzshX
Wisconsin's breweries contribute to our local economy and our state's culture. This shutdown is threatening the ability to sell our beer across state lines, and is hurting our businesses.   https://t.co/vsakyF3CYS
The shutdown is hurting Wisconsin farmers, businesses and families. Both sides need to get in the same room and have a meaningful discussion about how to move forward. Let‚Äôs reopen the government and get serious about 21st-century border security.
"It‚Äôs just one more punch in the gut farmers have to overcome.‚Äù 
The shutdown and the consequences of this trade war are hitting Wisconsin's rural economy especially hard. Enough is enough. https://t.co/yz52S4Q0WX
