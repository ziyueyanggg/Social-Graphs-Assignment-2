@FoodDepository In 2015, we heard testimony from a graduate of @fooddepository’s Chicago’s Community Kitchens program. It was clear then that this program makes a real difference in people's lives, and that’s even more clear today.
Stopped by the Greater Chicago @fooddepository to see firsthand their Chicago's Community Kitchens job training program, which I first learned about when I chaired the House Ag Subcommittee on Nutrition. https://t.co/xrFNlSPAhd
I’m grateful to @RepDannyDavis for hosting me in Illinois’ 7th District today and impressed by the work being done in this community. Looking forward to continuing our work together to help workers and families thrive. https://t.co/cZV1U8co1c

Through comprehensive services – including transitional housing, job training, and family support – @NewMomsChicago gives young women and their children a better chance to thrive.

I’m in Chicago today with my colleague @RepDannyDavis, Chairman of the W&amp;M Worker and Family Support Subcommittee. As the top Republican on the subcommittee, I’m excited to learn more about organizations and initiatives making a difference in his community. https://t.co/szbnU6JbTe
@Franchising411 The Veterans Entrepreneurship Act is a simple, commonsense step to help our brave men and women in uniform achieve the American Dream when they come home. https://t.co/JklpXScxmC
@Franchising411 My bipartisan bill, the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act, would lower up-front costs for veterans opening a franchise by cutting red tape and creating a tax credit to cover 25 percent of initial franchise fees. https://t.co/sqHoPmcIkF
According to @Franchising411’s VetFran program, more than 6,500 veterans have become franchise business owners since 2011. We can do more to help veterans by reducing the barriers that often stand in the way of starting a small business.
Norm Robertson is an Air National Guard veteran who owns three Express Employment franchises in Indiana. He’s also active in the community giving back to those who served. https://t.co/igYkYZLgnT

Throughout his life in public service, Dan Coats has always put the interests of his country and his fellow Hoosiers first. I am grateful for Dan’s steadfast leadership in keeping our nation safe and secure, and for his years of dedicated service to the American people.
Robocalls have been a nuisance to Hoosiers for too long. The House passed an important measure to crack down on illegal scammers and #robocalls and empower the FCC to impose tougher penalties on those who violate the law.

In order to find commonsense solutions to the challenges people face, both parties need to put aside divisive rhetoric and engage in a civil debate that reflects our nation’s values. (2/2)

It was an honor to speak at the @NRFnews Retail Advocacy Bootcamp this week. I was grateful to hear from small business owners who are shaping and growing our economy, like Danny Reynolds of Stephenson’s of Elkhart.

Congress’ most important responsibility is to provide for the national defense and support our brave men and women in uniform. The #NDAA passed by the House today falls short of these goals and breaks a longstanding tradition of bipartisan cooperation.

Great to meet with Sandi Morris, RDN, with @INDietitians. We discussed legislative initiatives to help improve Hoosiers’ health and wellness through food and nutrition, including a bill I’m proud to cosponsor: the Expanding Access to Diabetes Self-Management Training Act. https://t.co/jhLEzb9YGG

In an op-ed in the South Bend Tribune, I make the case for USMCA – and call for a vote in Congress as soon as possible. Read my op-ed here: https://t.co/DLbEyj4msI
#USMCA will drive job creation, increase exports, and keep America’s economic momentum going. It will benefit Hoosier manufacturers, farmers, workers, and families. Now Congress simply needs to take a vote. https://t.co/DLbEyj4msI
Check out my op-ed in the South Bend Tribune about how President Trump’s modernized trade deal with Mexico and Canada is good for Hoosiers and why Congress needs to vote on USMCA without delay. https://t.co/DLbEyj4msI
61,983 Hoosier jobs depend on manufacturing exports to Canada and Mexico. President Trump’s #USMCA trade deal will boost exports of Indiana-made products and create good jobs for hardworking Hoosiers. https://t.co/Kwo6sWoVuH
The Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act is now law, which means these veterans will finally get the benefits they earned. I applaud President Trump for signing this long overdue bill following unanimous passage in the House and Senate. https://t.co/vCGBOq3PDK

What Hoosier farmers need most is long-term certainty – and that’s exactly what #USMCA will bring. Congress should act without delay to approve this strong, modernized trade deal.
President Trump’s modernized trade deal with Mexico and Canada will help Hoosier farmers sell more corn, soybeans, pork, and other Indiana-grown products. It’s time for Congress to vote on #USMCA. https://t.co/ePkq3ZX3eA
