His faith led him to a life of public service, and his stalwart belief in equality and democracy fueled his pursuit for truth and justice. To many of us, Elijah was the moral compass for this hallowed chamber.

Today, our country mourns the loss of a great champion of truth, and my colleagues and I mourn the loss of a dear friend. Elijah Cummings came to Congress to represent his community in Baltimore, and throughout his tenure he represented much more.

Over 415k children are living in foster care in the U.S. Tomorrow, I'll be participating in #FosterYouthShadowDay as foster youth from across the country will meet with Members of Congress to talk about how government can improve our child welfare system.  #FosterYouthVoices
Two years ago today, the president decided to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and put the future of nation’s economy and public health at risk. I voted for the #ClimateActionNow Act, which blocks Trump from removing us. America can either lead or be left behind.
Congratulations to the 8th graders of Hazelton Elementary! I’m never more optimistic about our nation’s future than when I’m surrounded by bright young people who will lead the next generation. https://t.co/WwGcxY3lJN
Looking forward to a great discussion next week! Hope you can join us! https://t.co/AJ6Ktn849P
On #MemorialDay, we pay tribute to the brave men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice to protect our country and all that we stand for. Thank you to our nation’s heroes and their families, who also sacrifice so much so that their loved ones can serve. https://t.co/j0CTilVaHw
Since abandoning the Iran Deal, the U.S. has forfeited its position of diplomatic strength in pursuit of a reckless ideology. The President is now escalating his aggression by deploying 1,500 additional soldiers to the Middle East, which may provoke a wider conflict.
I recently introduced bipartisan legislation to put the federal government on a path to harness the full potential of AI in a responsible way – one that will enhance government’s ability to fulfill its mission, create new economic opportunities &amp; reduce potential harmful effects. https://t.co/3kwqvMuULP
We exist because of the diverse array of living organisms all around us. But because of humans, 1 million species are in danger of extinction. If we don’t #ActOnClimate &amp; #StopExtinction, we could lose the animals &amp; plants that make Earth livable. #InternationalBiodiversityDay
To mitigate and combat the threats of #climatechange, our nation must #ActOnClimate now and invest in a clean energy future for all Americans. That’s why I’m proud to support the #LIFTAmerica Act, which would fund the installation of solar panels in underserved communities. https://t.co/Flxm2W2cE7
Yesterday’s Grid Innovation and Infrastructure Expo featured cutting edge technologies that are paving the way for a cleaner, modernized power grid. Thanks to my co-hosts @boblatta, @Edison_Electric, @NEMAupdates and @gridwisedc. https://t.co/qQ0yRAN2lq

100 years ago, the House of Representatives passed the 19th Amendment. Today, we’re celebrating this milestone in our nation’s history by wearing a yellow rose in honor of those who fought to give women a voice in our government. #WomensVote100 https://t.co/IgC0hkd3a9
Mr. President, stop provoking and start talking. Use all diplomatic channels to ease tensions with Iran. https://t.co/eWqhRJpWBv
I can’t imagine what it was like to be the first to see that groundbreaking image of a black hole – and to know your work contributed to this achievement – but I think Dr. Katie Bouman sums it up perfectly. #WomenInSTEM https://t.co/3FjpKSxeX9
We cannot claim to be the land of the free until all our citizens have equal protection under the law. For many #LGBTQ Americans that is not the reality. But today @HouseDemocrats have said no more by passing #HR5 because fairness &amp; equality are our nation's core values. https://t.co/HhH5w3YhAb
Thanks to Dr. Katie Bouman and  members of the @ehtelescope team for testifying before @HouseScience about their groundbreaking work capturing the first image of a black hole, and about the importance of continued investment in scientific advancement. https://t.co/U8yrvtLWNQ
Millions of Americans who rely on prescription drugs are depending on Congress to ensure their medications are affordable. This week, the House is taking action #ForThePeople and voting on critical legislation to lower drug costs and #ProtectOurCare.
By escalating tensions with Iran, this administration sends us closer to another senseless war without any Congressional input or our Constitutionally-required authorization for use of military force. After decades of endless war, the American people have had enough. #NoIranWar
In 2019, 25 million Americans in rural communities still lack access to affordable high-speed internet. Closing the digital divide means increased job and educational opportunities for those Americans. #RuralBroadband
On this day, let’s honor the special women in our lives who have guided us and made a positive impact on us. Today, I’ll be celebrating with my wife Mary, whose love, kindness and strength has been the bedrock of our family. Happy #MothersDay to all those celebrating today.
This week, the administration announced it will be increasing our military presence in Iranian territory. By doing so, President Trump is intensifying tensions with Iran, and putting our troops in danger with his aggressive tactics. https://t.co/zqyTHpiZer
The Trump Administration is trying to take us back to a time when it was legal to discriminate against Americans with pre-existing conditions. But we won't let that happen. That’s why I'm voting for the Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/cMWfRqj06F
Great to have @SJCOG in Washington today! I’m committed to fighting for critical infrastructure investments and essential transportation funding for our area, and I look forward to continuing to work with these dedicated community leaders to strengthen our region. https://t.co/D6eoW3USVO
Small businesses are the backbone of our economy - they create two out of every three new jobs each year. This #NationalSmallBusinessWeek and every week, I’m proud to honor our hardworking small business men and women, and to champion the small businesses in my district. https://t.co/WQij8x8FKh
Instead, he would rather split hairs over the honesty of his answers and forego answering anymore questions all together.
His answers before the Senate Judiciary Committee and his failure to appear before the House Judiciary Committee confirm that he is not committed to the job he is charged with: upholding our constitution.
This week, Attorney General Barr proved that he is working to protect the president, and not working on behalf of the American people.
As a long-time opponent of the wasteful and ill-conceived #DeltaTunnels, I’m looking forward to working with @GavinNewsom and others on a comprehensive approach to a sustainable water future for California. https://t.co/7nfMT4Q5H9
Today the House passed H.R. 9, the #ClimateActionNow Act. The U.S. has always led by example. That's why it's imperative that we rejoin the Paris Climate Accord. If we retreat, we are condemning future generations to a world filled with catastrophic #climatechange and conflict. https://t.co/qY8ERipnT9
The President’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement puts the future of our environment, economy, and health at risk. It’s time to say “We are still in.” #ClimateActionNow
Thanks to everyone who came out to my Antioch open house! As I head back to Washington, I’m re-energized after hearing your stories, ideas and concerns, and I’m looking forward to continuing to work on your behalf. https://t.co/8TTRlgN7BH
Hope to see you on Friday at my open house! Please stop by my Antioch office anytime between 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM to hear what's going on in Washington and to share your views on issues important to you and our community. https://t.co/HaK6Qkgpiz
My thoughts go out to those affected by last night's fire — especially the brave firefighter who was injured while working to extinguish the blaze. Thank you to all of our first responders who routinely put the safety of our community before their own.

Thanks to everyone who came out to my Stockton open house! I’m looking forward to catching up with more folks at my Antioch open house next week! https://t.co/fOS7T8ehPr
It was great to see so many people that care about our environment, science, and the importance of “moving green” out today at the Stockton Earth Day Festival! https://t.co/VlDjb69C1b
I hope you’ll join me in wishing our Sikh American neighbors and friends a very happy #Vaisakhi!
This week in the world of science, two groundbreaking advances made the headlines. From the first image of a black hole to the discovery of a new human relative, this was only possible because of humanity’s innate drive to know more. https://t.co/hEFIx9aTEh
Because of the hard work of some extraordinary scientists we are able to witness something that is truly amazing: the first picture of a black hole. We need to think about this as something bigger than ourselves.

The first 100 days of the 116th Congress have been focused on protecting the rights of voters, fighting #climatechange, ensuring LGBTQ rights, and protecting dreamers. I look forward to the work that will continue to be done throughout this Congress. #100DaysForThePeople
You called, wrote letters, attended town halls and made your voices heard. Today is a victory for free speech, democracy and above all the American people. #SaveTheNet https://t.co/VEM4BR0eDi
The House of Representatives just passed the #SavetheNet Act! I’m proud to be an original cosponsor of this critical legislation that will restore strong #netneutrality protections for my constituents and all Americans.
The #SaveTheNet Act takes an approach that accounts for the internet of today and of tomorrow, and it provides certainty for Americans across the country. I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of this critical legislation, and I'll continue to fight to restore #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/ob9D3mXBrQ

If you're in the Antioch area, I hope you can stop by my open house on April 26th. I'll be hosting it at my Antioch office from 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM, and I'm looking forward to having some great discussions about the issues that are most important to you. https://t.co/pml2M6CJWE
As a former wind energy engineer, I can tell you the president's recent claims are blatantly false. Wind is one of the lowest-priced sources of energy, and unlike fossil fuels, it produces no harmful emissions that contribute to #climatechange. https://t.co/Q001EVugZ4
Today is World Autism Day – a day to promote understanding and acceptance of people with autism and their unique strengths and challenges. #Congress4LIUB
#EqualPay is not just an issue for women. It impacts families, businesses and our economy. The House has passed the #PaycheckFairnessAct to ensure equal pay for equal work, and now it’s the Senate’s turn.
Unsafe levels of contamination in drinking water disproportionately affects vulnerable communities. The president’s #DirtyWaterRule will put the health of Americans across the country at further risk. Safe drinking water is a human right, &amp; we must #ProtectCleanWater for all.
Trump’s #DirtyWaterRule will put the drinking water sources for tens of millions of people at risk, as well as the wetlands that communities rely on for flood protection. It's time to #ProtectCleanWater.
I'll be hosting an open house at my Stockton office on Thursday, April 18th from 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM EST. I hope to see you there! https://t.co/q7FOlBaoGp
This week, @HouseDemocrats introduced two major pieces of legislation to preserve protections for people with pre-existing conditions and to recommit the U.S. to leading the fight against #climatechange. https://t.co/Zg0pV6JsHF
On #VietnamVeteransDay, we commemorate the withdrawal of U.S. combat and combat support units from South Vietnam in 1973. We thank all those who served and honor those who did not return home.
Thanks to the representatives from @CalStateEastBay who stopped by my DC office. I’ve long fought to expand access to higher education and I’ll continue to defend crucial federal funding  - especially Pell Grants, which enable countless students to continue their education. https://t.co/kBigFCQ2GW

Today in #SubCommTech we took a critical step in the fight to restore #netneutrality by advancing #SavetheNet to the full @EnergyCommerce. This important piece of legislation would reestablish vital net neutrality protections to ensure a free and open internet #ForThePeople. https://t.co/lNFfveQWiy

#Netneutrality fuels competition &amp; innovation in our economy, enables the internet to be an equalizer &amp; is essential for our democracy. The #SaveTheNet Act is a simple &amp; straightforward bill that would restore net neutrality protections, &amp; I’m proud to be an original cosponsor.
Earlier this week I joined Mike Burkholder to talk about some of issues I’m working on and what’s happening in Washington. Check out the link for the the full interview.

Great turn out at yesterday’s Veterans Town Hall! Thank you to everyone who came and participated in the informative discussion. https://t.co/0D3WirCVKm
I am cosponsoring the #SaveTheNet Act to restore critical #NetNeutrality protections. These protections are the core of a free and open internet, and ensure consumers – not corporations – are in control.
I had the opportunity to meet with Oakley Mayor Claire Alaura to discuss how we can work together on important issues in our community - including transportation and public safety. At the end of our meeting, I was honored when she presented me with the key to the city. https://t.co/r858mwVSAd
As a mathematician, #PiDay holds a special place in my heart. While you enjoy your sweet treat today, it’s also the perfect occasion to reflect on the importance of science and mathematics in our lives. https://t.co/r0LnglDHeQ
Restoring #NetNeutrality is one of most important digital rights issues today. The #SaveTheNet Act gives the power back to the people, stops abusive corporate practices, and fosters innovation and competition.
The Delta is the lifeblood of our community – that’s why I proudly cosponsored legislation to designate the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta as California’s first National Heritage Area. Today is a great victory for the Delta region as that legislation has been signed into law. https://t.co/Q3G4FuNatn
When the @FCC moved to repeal #netneutrality, more than 8,000 of my constituents reached out to my office to express their concerns. The #SaveTheNet Act will restore these crucial protections, and I’m proud to be an original cosponsor of this important legislation. https://t.co/B8XDvey4ID
Today was a good day in Washington because the House passed the #ForThePeople Act. I’m proud to be on the right side of history as a cosponsor of this important legislation, which would put our government back in the hands of the American people. https://t.co/2dkXYYVv01

Today, Port of Stockton Director Richard Aschieris &amp; I discussed the Port’s future &amp; its contributions to our community. It is the 4th busiest port in California &amp; employs over 10,000 people. As a member of the Congressional Ports Caucus, I’ll continue to fight for its success. https://t.co/hVoTtTK96T
As a co-chair of the Bipartisan #CampaignFinance Reform Caucus, I am committed to fixing our broken system &amp; ending the undue influence of money in our elections. The #ForThePeople Act is a vital step toward restoring the voice of the voters &amp; I’m proud to be a cosponsor.

As I voted in favor of H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112, I thought of those impacted by the Cleveland Elementary School shooting. Gun violence is an epidemic, but we can make our communities safer with common sense gun reforms like these. https://t.co/MkDDN6iMt4
