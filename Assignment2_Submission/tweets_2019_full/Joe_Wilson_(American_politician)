Yesterday, I with my colleagues introduced HR 4868, the Stop UN Support for Assad Act of 2019, which will ensure that U.S. taxpayer money does not go to the criminal Assad regime in Damascus.
As an original cosponsor, I am grateful that the Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children Act passed the House of Representatives today. We are in the midst of a youth vaping epidemic and it is crucial that we prevent even more children from tobacco addiction.

The admission that Chairman Schiff intentionally mislead the American people to slander President Trump is further proof that these accusations are baseless and simply an attempt to undo the will of the American people in pursuit of destructive politics.
Since the day President Trump was elected, Democrats have been working to subvert the efforts of 63 million Americans.
As of last week, my bill to repeal the unjust “Widow’s Tax” now has 379 co-sponsors, the most co-sponsors of any bill this Congress. With this wide range of bipartisan support, it is frustrating that we can not end this unfair taxation on our military families. #AxeWidowsTax
Ceding territory in Syria to Russia, Iran, Turkey, Assad and ISIS is not the right decision. We must return to the fundamentals of peace through strength. There is simply no substitute for American leadership.
Happy 244th birthday to the @USNavy. I am so grateful for the brave men and women of the U.S. Navy who work to protect our freedom every day. https://t.co/oBslINS162
I urge the Administration to reconsider this misguided decision. There is simply no substitute for American leadership.
The decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Syria – who fought bravely on the front lines against ISIS – is disappointing. Ceding territory in northeastern Syria to Turkey, Iran, and Russia will only set the stage for continued destabilization and an eventual resurgence of ISIS

It is disappointing that instead of addressing issues truly affecting Americans, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi continues this divisive, baseless attack on President Trump.
Since President Trump was first elected, Democrats have been obsessively scraping for any sign of alleged wrongdoing by the Administration and citing impeachment. Every time a new accusation comes to light, it is backed by unsubstantiated evidence and later disproved.
My wife Roxanne and I extend our deepest sympathies to @WhipClyburn and his entire family during this painful time. Dr. Emily England Clyburn was a remarkable woman, wife, mother, and grandmother, this is a tremendous loss.
As a conferee, I will continue to promote peace through strength and work to champion repeal of the unjust "Widow’s Tax." I look forward to working with the conference committee to advance this bipartisan legislation. #AxeWidowsTax

Incredible news! South Carolina’s Veteran Unemployment Rate Drops Significantly in 2018.

Our nation’s military personnel risk their lives to defend our nation &amp; our freedoms—they should be able to trust that the benefits they designate for their spouses &amp; families will provide for them. Join me in celebrating #MilitarySpouseAppreciationDay #AxeWidowsTax
I was grateful to introduce HR 553, which eliminates an unfair deduction of benefits on surviving spouses of service members when their spouse passes away during active duty. It also applies to surviving spouses of retirees who pass away because of a service-connected cause.
As a 31-year veteran and the father of four military sons who have served oversees in Iraq, Egypt, and Afghanistan, I understand first-hand how important military spouses are and the difference they make. Military spouses provide constant support and strength for our troops. https://t.co/RHLFbyM0Tf
I look forward to supporting a supplemental appropriations bill that would be signed into law by @POTUS &amp; provide much-needed relief for South Carolinians.
It is crucial that Republicans &amp; Democrats come together to provide funding for states to recover &amp; rebuild from the recent devastating natural disasters. Unfortunately, this was a partisan measure that was negotiated without Republican input.
Happy National Nurses Week! Nurses are protectors, leaders, and deliver life-saving care. I'm grateful to the vast contributions and positive impact of our #SC02 nurses. https://t.co/8RdXLOiFHD

That’s why I’ve joined my colleagues as an original co-sponsor of the #NationalRightToWork Act, introduced by @RepJoeWilson, and I will continue to fight for the freedom of our American workers.

I join the people of the State of Israel in celebrating 71 years since the founding of the Jewish State. This year &amp; all others, the American people are proud to stand by Israel and celebrate the historic return of the Jewish people to their ancient homeland. #Israel71
80% of people in our country support putting an end to dues as a condition of employment. I am grateful to stand alongside 52 colleagues to offer protections for workers and their employers.
South Carolina is a right-to-work state, and we have seen tremendous economic growth by expanding economic freedom for our businesses. We must continue to work towards promoting job creation and ending automatic unionism for the American people.
Every American and their employer should have the power to negotiate the terms of their employment, and no American should be forced to pay union dues or ‘fees’ just to get or keep a job.

Happy National Travel &amp; Tourism Week. In South Carolina, tourism is a $22.6 billion industry &amp; supports 1 in 10 jobs. Tourism’s economic impact on South Carolina has grown again, marking 6 yrs of consecutive record-breaking growth for the state’s visitor industry. #TravelMatters https://t.co/BvPXp24Vn7

I send my heartfelt condolences to the families of the four Israelis killed and pray for peace in the region.
They are further evidence of Hamas and Islamic Jihad’s disregard for the Palestinian people whom they use both as human shields and hostages in their confrontations with Israel. The US will continue to stand by the people of Israel and support its right to self-defense.
I strongly urge the Iranian-funded terrorist groups, Hamas and PIJ, to respect today’s ceasefire and halt all rocket fire toward Israel. The terrorist rocket attacks from Gaza are unprovoked, indiscriminate, and must be condemned in the strongest terms.
Happy #NationalSmallBusinessWeek to our local entrepreneurs for their important role of growing businesses and creating jobs in our communities. 

I was grateful to kick off Small Business Week with @ColaChamber to highlight small businesses in #SC02. @CityofColumbia @columbiaobo https://t.co/opY2097nik

It is incredible to see more than 250 co-sponsors for the Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act, and we appreciate our colleagues joining us in support of this important legislation. #AxeWidowsTax
Bipartisanship is often portrayed as something that can’t be achieved by Congress, but we are grateful to share some good news. Republicans and Democrats are coming together to put an end to the so-called Widow’s Tax.

This evil act of anti-Semitism has no place in the United States of America. I stand with the Jewish community in the face of this unspeakable hatred.
Heartbroken by the tragic attack at the Chabad of Poway synagogue on the last day of Passover. The congregants gathered that day were targeted because of one reason only: they were Jews.
The American people stand steadfast beside the people of Sri Lanka in mourning and solidarity. https://t.co/qCqNTbpCuR
