Thank you @ShopFloorNAM for having @RepKevinBrady and I today to discuss our work in passing the USMCA. It is critical to have this dialogue between the public and private sector in order to pass a trade deal that benefits American workers. https://t.co/PNUhplTUTd
My condolences to the family of former SCOTUS Justice Stevens. When asked about his legacy he said, "I did the best I could,"-a sentiment being shared today by many court observers &amp; legal experts. His 35 years at the court will have an everlasting impact in our nation.
The longer these trade wars drag on, the more American farmers suffer. Our agricultural industry should no longer be collateral damage to blanket tariffs or partisan politics.

America is in a high-stakes battle between China for global leadership in 5G. To become a leader in the future of communications technology, we need to ensure that the U.S. is at the table when setting international standards for the 5G network.

We aren't just a nation of immigrants, we are a caucus &amp; a congress of immigrants. The President's comments were inappropriate &amp; uncalled for. We must not become accustomed to, nor tolerate, racially or culturally insensitive comments from the President or any member of Congress.

We must ensure the 2020 Census remains immune to political bias. We cannot spend millions of taxpayers’ dollars for a citizenship question, this will result in suppressed participation and inaccurate results. Read @RepJoseSerrano's statement here: https://t.co/Qe6AM9vbkU
The USMCA is a win for Texas and the U.S. This deal will create jobs and open new markets for U.S. industries.  We need to focus on finalizing a trade agreement that prioritizes American workers and businesses.
