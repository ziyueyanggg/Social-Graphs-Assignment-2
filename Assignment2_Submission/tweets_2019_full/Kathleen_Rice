This legislation was first brought to my attention by two women from #NY04. Karen Henley, who lost her husband Mike to younger-onset in 2012, and Connie Wasserman, who runs a mostly privately-funded program for families like the Henleys who have nowhere else to go for help. 3/4
For too long, Americans living with  younger-onset Alzheimer‚Äôs and their families have been denied access to vital, federally-funded services offered by the OAA simply because they are under the age of 60.
