It is past time that we #payblackwomen their worth.  As a co sponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act I have been a longtime advocate for economic security and #EqualPayForEqualWork. Congress needs to take action to address this pay gap immediately. #BlackWomenCantWait
This is unacceptable. Black women are often the backbone of their communities. Studies have indicated that Black mothers are far more likely to be the primary or sole breadwinner for their families. Their contributions are invaluable.
Today is #BlackWomensEqualPayDay which marks how many days in 2019 it would take the average Black woman worker to make the same as a white non Hispanic male worker in 2018. In 2017 Black women earned only 61 cents for every $1 earned by white, non Hispanic male workers. https://t.co/2hU6bIAFFO
