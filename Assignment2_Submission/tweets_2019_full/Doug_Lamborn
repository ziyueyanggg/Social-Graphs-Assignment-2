House Dem's have issued more subpoenas (56) than House bills signed into law (46). Democrats have no agenda outside of impeachment. Instead, we should be fixing the broken healthcare system, lowering prescription drug prices, passing USMCA, and funding our military.

Nothing can erase human dignity. Dignity is a God-given right to follow our conscience and to seek fulfillment for our soul. Freedom of religion is one of the values that makes America great, and we are blessed to be a part of a truly pluralistic religious society. #IRFRoundTable https://t.co/Y9mpR4IyG8
As Co-Chair of the House Values Action Team, I was pleased to have @SecretaryCarson brief our caucus about the reforms @HUDgov has been working on, and I'm honored to work with him to continue finding ways to offer affordable housing and services to people in need. https://t.co/3UOmxI8I8v
Apollo 11, 50 yrs ago today,  took flight- and ushered in a new era of dreams, possibility, ingenuity, and patriotism. We honor Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins, and all of the men and women at @NASA for their bravery, hard work, and leadership. #Apollo50th https://t.co/H0HUmTbsPW
I applaud @SecBernhardt for relocating the @BLMNational to Grand Junction. This move will make the department more efficient and bring BLM policy makers closer to the people most affected by their decisions. https://t.co/ydZpSlIlke

While freedom is under attack in many parts of the world, the Trump Administration is taking historic strides to protect people of all faiths.  Thank you @IRF_Ambassador for your leadership in promoting religious freedom around the world!
I am honored to be speaking to the International Religious Freedom Roundtable tomorrow night to celebrate the opening of the 2nd Annual Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom.
The rule of law is a cornerstone of our republic. ICE agents are charged with enforcing our immigration laws without regard to the partisan rancor on the left.  I am grateful to their service &amp; implore elected officials to stop slandering their honor &amp; politicizing their duties.
Yesterday at #WCS19 I sat down with @JanJekielek from the @EpochTimes and talked about the work I'm doing to protect the religious conscience and views of the men and women serving in our military. The interview goes live at 7 PM ET here: https://t.co/H6SaIzYnOF https://t.co/pszoKQeNox

I was glad to join so many of my colleagues in signing this letter, urging @POTUS to take action and protect our national security interests by combating our foreign dependence on uranium.@westerncaucus https://t.co/zGiyDF2hTe
This NDAA Amendment was absolutely embarrassing for House Dems. They continue to falsely slander @POTUS on a trumped-up emoluments claim which has already been cleared by the courts. We MUST continue to support the President as he fights to rebuild and protect our military. https://t.co/X7jHTHYf6R
It is an honor to stand shoulder to shoulder with @GOPLeader and call Democrats out for putting politics before our duty to the men and women in uniform. #NDAA https://t.co/lQLxwT7eZb
This bill is about ensuring the men and women in our armed services have what they need to defend our great nation. As presented- it does not meet these requirements.
We have a top priority in Congress of providing for the defense of our nation. Rather than focusing on the task in front of us, Democrats chose to put politics first, inserting partisan poison pill amendments into the NDAA- which has been historically bipartisan for 60 years. https://t.co/2IMAcCwbBU
Democrats are harming our national security by adding damaging, partisan provisions to the NDAA, to include:
-an arbitrary budget that would undercut military readiness,
-attempts to close Guant√°namo Bay, and
-efforts to block the President from alleviating the border crisis.
We should be focused on growing the economy and creating more high-quality jobs, but House Democrats would rather give Washington more control over how we live our lives.
https://t.co/NFK43h4XNG
According to the nonpartisan @CBO, a federally mandated minimum wage increase would mean millions of Americans put out of work.
I will continue to fight against this radical policy leftover from the Obama Administration.
Dems are trying to use backdoor methods in their highly partisan version of the NDAA to force the @POTUS to close Guant√°namo Bay, and potentially moving the worst of the worst terrorists to the US, many to facilities in @CanonCityGov.
Last month, the U.S. Economy added 224,000 jobs. Our economy is booming, and unemployment remains at near record lows. In fact, nominal average hourly earnings have risen 3.1% over the last year, which is the largest year-over-year percent wage gain since 2009.
Happy Independence Day and God Bless America! May our freedom continue to ring and liberty continue to grow! https://t.co/z13nXzBVXG
I want to sincerely thank @CBP and @ICEgov for their hard work these last few months. With overwhelming numbers of illegal migrants and dwindling funds their jobs have been increasingly difficult. I am glad we have finally funded the ongoing humanitarian crisis at the border.
Iran‚Äôs self-reported violations of multiple international nuclear agreements are dangerous and unacceptable. I support President Trump in protecting America and her allies from Iran‚Äôs lethal nuclear aspirations.

Border Crisis Trumps Partisan Politics https://t.co/XufcC3N25E
House Democrats are STILL refusing to work in a bipartisan manner to address the worsening humanitarian crisis at the border. The Senate bill passed with 84 votes and could be signed into law by @POTUS TODAY. I call upon @SpeakerPelosi to bring this legislation to the floor NOW.
RT @Franklin_Graham: Congress needs to pass H.R. 3393. Besides being unconstitutional spending, why should one network not have to compete‚Ä¶RT @Congress needs to pass H.R. 3393. Besides being unconstitutional spending, why should one network not have to compete and get a free ride to publish so many views offensive to Americans? The free ride should be over! 2/2
Thank you @Franklin_Graham for your support of my legislation to defund CPB. It is past time we stop using government funds to support liberal programs which are indoctrinating our youth. https://t.co/40FCpsA3QZ
I am excited to welcome @BetsyDeVosED to the district to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of Parents Challenge and their school choice program. Our national policies should empower parents to choose schools that best fit the needs of their children!
There is an ongoing crisis at the border and Democrats continue to play partisan games. The bill H.R. 3401: 1) did not fund immigration judges 2) did not support the national guard stationed at the border and 3) undermined the ability for HHS to care for unaccompanied minors.
For 56 days, House Dems have turned a blind eye to this crisis, sat on their hands, and refused to act. Now, at the 11th hour, they‚Äôre proposing legislation that would not adequately address the crisis and are attempting to politicize the debate, instead solving the problem.
Listen to me today on #WashingtonWatch hosted by @tperkins. I will be speaking on my legislation to cut federal funding for NPR and CPB. We need to stand for traditional values, freedom of conscience, and common sense spending. https://t.co/Q8r5wEq01N
I want to thank @FRCdc and @tperkins for their support of my legislation to defund PBS. Read my op-ed below from @DailySignal.

This is a huge win for the pro-life movement. @POTUS is the strongest #ProLife President in U.S. history.

Mark Esper is a great forward-thinking leader and I‚Äôve enjoyed working with him as @SecArmy, where he's done a great job.

If Democrats truly cared about countering Russian aggression they wouldn‚Äôt have broken with the bipartisan consensus on nuclear modernization and would have supported a $750B topline to modernize our military against near-peer threats like Russia and China.
