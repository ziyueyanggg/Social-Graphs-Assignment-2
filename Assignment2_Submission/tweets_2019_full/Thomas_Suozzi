We need to encourage students to explore trade schools &amp; union apprenticeship programs as a realistic path to the American Dream.
This morning I spoke at the @phccnatl 's Legislative Conference about our urgent need to build a better-skilled workforce.
A four-year college degree is no longer a guarantee to a high-paying job.
Congratulations to these students, and to Steven Markowitz, Chairman of HMTCNY, for your dedication to teaching the history of the Holocaust and its lessons through education and community outreach. May we never forget.
An "Upstander‚Äù is a person who stands up for others and does not stand by allowing bigotry, hatred or intolerance to happen without interjection. What the world needs now are more Upstanders!

Sadly, the stain of anti-Semitism lingers. Today must be not only a day for remembrance but, also a call to action. We must recommit ourselves to condemn and combat anti-Semitism and hatred each and every time it rears its ugly head.

May we never forget.
This morning, I attended a Congressional Remembrance Ceremony for Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day, where I lit a candle in remembrance of the six million Jews and millions of others who perished in the most brutal genocide in history. https://t.co/UkeYhHpsk9

The US set its own goals. Now, the current administration has said we will pull out at the earliest possible date...November 2020.

A recent report from the administration found that Social Security and Medicare funds face insolvency, and that 50-year-old's may not get full retirement benefits.
