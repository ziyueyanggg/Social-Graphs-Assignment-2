When our country operates under continuing budget resolutions, the strength and readiness of our military suffers and our ability to make investments in jobs is hindered. 4/4
Coming to an agreement has proved elusive since the President’s budget proposal eviscerated funding for programs that invest in our infrastructure, transportation systems, research and development, and the health of our people. 3/4
Today’s funding crisis began almost four months ago on October 1, 2017, and until a budget is established for our military and our economy, we cannot proceed. 2/4
Establishing a bipartisan budget agreement is my most immediate priority so that we can adequately and quickly fund our military and economic programs. 1/4

DACA participants work legally, pay taxes, and contribute to the US economy. They do not deserve to be in this situation of uncertainty and fear. I support the DREAM Act and it is past time that Congress allows this important bill to be debated and voted upon.
I believe that tax reform legislation must provide greater equity among taxpayers, encourage productive economic investments, and not increase the national deficit. I opposed the House Republican tax legislation because it meets none of these requirements.
This morning I testified at the U.S. ITC hearing on wire rod. I stated that we must not waiver in our efforts, and we must continue to apply pressure on countries that blatantly violate our trade laws and threaten the American steel industry and American steelworkers. https://t.co/Fbk7C9OZ76
