It's time we returned to foreign policy that reflects our values, which means concrete strategies from our administration to combat ISIS, protect our allies, and keep Americans safe.
While President Trump recklessly abandoned our allies and cleared the way for Turkey's onslaught, these strong, targeted sanctions will not be lifted until Turkey withdraws from Syrian territory.
Today, Congress came together to rebuke Turkey's brutal invasion of Syria with a bipartisan sanctions bill that targets Turkish officials who orchestrated attacks intended to kill and expel Kurds from the region, among other human rights abuses.

Climate change is too great of a challenge to tackle with one party. If Republicans won't listen to the economic argument from major car companies and others, maybe they can listen to evangelicals and religious leaders who know we have a moral imperative to save God's planet.

We know our binational region succeeds when we work together. The U.S. and Mexico must commit to obligate some of the new prosperity generated by USMCA to solving this urgent health crisis.
My San Diego colleagues and I proposed legislation to increase federal funds for projects to address wastewater, sanitation, and pollution. With the help of @RepCuellar, a piece of that bill package passed the Financial Services Committee.
Our two nations have a long history of cooperation‚Äîone that benefits both our economies through investments like the San Ysidro Port of Entry, which boosted trade and tourism. Now our two regions must partner together again to address the Tijuana sewage crisis.

Therefore, federal investment in a large-scale transit project has the potential to address our housing shortage, to mitigate our urgent climate crisis, and to improve quality of life for our communities.
The bill also ensures there is a local commitment to change land-use policies to accommodate market-rate and affordable housing before the transit project receives funding.

Two years ago, the tragic shooting in Las Vegas left 58 people dead and more than 700 injured. Americans should not have to fear going out to enjoy something they love. It's far past time the Senate followed our lead and passed commonsense gun safety reforms. #VegasStrong https://t.co/bk1V5POgP9
Met with @HRC last week to celebrate passage of the Equality Act and discuss how we can continue the fight for equality by advancing voting rights and ensuring access to PrEP. https://t.co/1nciSU5OvF

Biosimilars offer an innovative, low-cost alternative for treating complex diseases, but only a fraction of Americans can access them. I introduced the bipartisan ACCESS Act to encourage their widespread use and help drive down prescription drug costs.

Everyone should have equal access to reproductive health care, but the  #HydeAmendment limits a woman's right to make her own health care decisions. I support the #EACHWomen Act to ensure the only person who has a say in that choice is the patient. #BeBoldEndHyde https://t.co/3j1uwMzlUq
Congrats to @MamasKitchenSD on serving their 9 millionth meal since 1990 to San Diegans most in need. Thank you for helping men, women, and children with HIV, cancer, and other serious illnesses that make them vulnerable to hunger.

We agree: Raiding critical defense funding for a fake emergency is a threat to our national security.
 
It's time President Trump accepted that Congress alone has the power of the purse.

üåä The @IPCC_CH just released a special report that found climate change is destroying our oceans: melting ice, sea level rise, acidification, coastal erosion, habitat destruction, and more.
 
We need #OceanClimateAction to protect oceans before it‚Äôs too late. https://t.co/QtWtxQZFZZ
The federal government should focus on funding infrastructure based on outcomes. Today in @HouseBudgetDems, I asked how the federal government can provide support and incentives for housing density. This is consistent with our bill, the Build More Housing Near Transit Act. https://t.co/7TwrQ6Ib0j

Today, Congress held its first ever hearing on President Trump's #MuslimBan. 

I cosponsored the NO BAN Act, which would overturn the Muslim Ban and block the implementation of future bans based on religious grounds. It's time to overturn this cruel and un-American policy. https://t.co/Ev98tjsK1L

There's no question Congress must exercise our oversight duty especially given Trump's confirmation that he pushed Ukraine to investigate a political rival for his own gain. We have a sworn duty to defend our democracy and rule of law.

California has led the way toward cleaner cars through innovation and proved we don't have to choose between our environment and economy. As usual, this move by the Trump Administration is a huge step backward for the planet, consumers, and business.

Our nation was founded on ‚ÄúNo Taxation Without Representation,‚Äù but 700,000 American citizens and DC residents have no vote in Congress. I co-sponsored HR51  which received its first hearing in 25 years this week. It's finally time for #DCStatehood.
Joined my colleagues to officially start negotiations for the final defense policy bill. These conversations ensure we put forward a strong national defense policy for the coming year to support a 21st-century force facing new and dynamic threats. https://t.co/cnSBQwUvTm

Dr. Emily England Clyburn was a force for change in education and civil rights. My deepest condolences go out to @WhipClyburn and their entire family.

@NOAA We can't afford to wait for the next record-breaking temperature to act on climate. That's why I created the #ClimatePlaybook, which contains bills that, together, can take immediate action on climate.

August temperatures were the second highest ever recorded in @NOAA history. The effects were felt around the world: warmer oceans, melting Arctic ice, sea level rise, and wildfires.

@davidfrum Finally, the rapid breakdown of the Senate as an instrument of deliberation and fairness is breathtaking. There were other qualified conservative candidates that would not have so divided us. But that‚Äôs now apparently the objective - a Senate feature not a bug. 3/3
@davidfrum It‚Äôs also shameful that the Senate would have constrained investigators at the FBI or that the administration would have allowed - let alone welcomed - such constraint. Another bedrock of American justice tarnished. 2/
@davidfrum It‚Äôs tragic that a person with Kavanaugh‚Äôs understanding of the importance of public confidence in the Supreme Court‚Äôs quality and fairness lied to gain admission to our national truth panel, to serve his own personal ambition. A self servant, not a public servant. 1/
For 25 years VAWA has trained law enforcement, strengthened our legal systems, and provided a lifeline for survivors. The House reauthorized VAWA with improved protections and justice for all survivors. Survivors need the Senate to pass HR1585. #VAWA25

@senatemajldr The House passed the Bipartisan Background Checks Act and the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019 with bipartisan support to strengthen background checks. 

But, Leader McConnell refuses to schedule these bills for a vote in the Senate.
@senatemajldr As I traveled throughout the district last month, I talked with many of you who said you feel both helpless and hopeless.

It‚Äôs clear we need to pass commonsense gun safety reforms and I'm taking this anger back to Washington.

Our bill will enable federal investment in transit to increase housing options for families across the country. It will also curb climate change through increased transit ridership, which takes cars off the road.
