There will be those who say it can’t be done any sooner, and to those people, I say get out of the way. For thousands of people in our state, these outages are incredibly frustrating and, in some cases, life-threatening. Worst of all, they’re unnecessary. (5/6)
PG&amp;E must commit fully to hardening and upgrading the electrical grid and California must get out of its own way and allow the type of tree trimming and management that’s necessary to improve safety. (4/6)
Years of bad policy decisions from Sacramento cannot be reversed overnight, but a decade in the dark is unacceptable. PG&amp;E has spent far more on renewable power ($2.4 billion) than they have on updating infrastructure ($1.5 billion). It's time to rethink those priorities. (3/6)
There are sometimes situations that require a larger degree of vigilance – everyone understands that – but we are not a third world county and the power should not be shut off for thousands of people every time the wind blows. (2/6)

This situation is unprecedented, but it’s not the President’s actions that are unprecedented – it is the actions of my Democratic colleagues who refuse to acknowledge this crisis.
#ICYMI Dems called @POTUS's emergency declaration at our border unprecedented.

Unprecedented is an immigration system overwhelmed by 1 million immigrants.

Unprecedented is Congress refusing to fund national security agencies &amp; threatening to abolish @ICEgov for doing their job. https://t.co/5UBNOmDmpi

Clearly, House Democrats are more interested in denying giving President @realDonaldTrump a win than helping the American people.

Enough excuses - the #USMCA is a bipartisan trade agreement with our closest neighbors &amp; trading partners, and the House should vote to approve it. https://t.co/Epc907VRcR
This week has made it abundantly clear that Democrats’ true priorities are impeaching @POTUS at all costs and catering to illegal immigrants, not the American people. (5/5)
It gives the agency only 90 days to implement an electronic system to track the health history of millions of illegal immigrants – a system that the @DeptVetAffairs or @DeptofDefense  won’t have the luxury of using for years to come. (4/5)
This bill would divert funds from critical @DHSgov  functions, like natural disaster response, border security, and counter-terrorism operations, and redirects them to the benefit of illegal immigrants. (3/5)
During a week where House Democrats have ramped up efforts to impeach the President @realDonaldTrump  for reasons they can’t quite explain, their legislative agenda won’t do much to reassure many Americans that may fear their best interests aren’t truly being considered. (2/5)
This week, House Democrats passed H.R. 3525 - legislation to prioritize healthcare for illegal immigrants before American servicemembers and veterans. I voted against it.(1/5)
In today’s @HouseAgGOP hearing, we underlined the need for improvement in our forest infrastructure. Not enough is being done to address our $5.2 billion maintenance backlog - including $400 million just on CA's roads in forest lands.

FEMA has approved public assistance funding for the removal of a significant number of hazardous burnt trees in Butte County. Under FEMA guidelines, burnt trees that remain standing aren't considered debris &amp; have not been removed as part of the Camp Fire debris removal process. https://t.co/tYo40rqTWD
They continue to drag the American people into this never-ending crusade against @POTUS - while important trade agreements, prescription drug pricing, and disaster relief legislation all languish - and they still have nothing except embarrassment to show for it.
What Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats assumed was their ace in the hole is, in fact, a dry hole. It turned out to be no more valuable to their months-long impeachment quest than yesterday’s dud of a call transcript.
His accounts were based on second-hand and even third-hand conversations, and with no supporting evidence whatsoever, cannot be considered anything more than hearsay.
So it turns out the so-called "whistleblower" into President @realDonaldTrump's phone call with the Ukrainian President had no direct knowledge of anything at all. https://t.co/eltK956nvG

@POTUS ---&gt;https://t.co/FODr7VTtPd https://t.co/n57Mscs6ln
The American people see right through the Democrats’ impeach-at-all-costs mentality, and they’re sick of it.
Democrats overplayed their hand – they accepted a baseless, second-hand account of a phone call as gospel without even a brief consideration of the facts. After all the frenzy, we have exactly what we started with yesterday morning – nothing.
I’ve read the call transcript and ‘underwhelmed’ is an understatement – it contains nothing that warrants even the slightest thought of impeaching the President.
Following a drama-filled announcement yesterday that House Democrats would open an impeachment inquiry into President @realDonaldTrump, today’s news has predictably brought them crashing back to Earth.

Windy weather conditions are expected to last until 12PM, Wednesday. https://t.co/RN4J0HOll9 https://t.co/gihvo65gD4
It’s partisan politics at its finest and the American people are tired of it – it’s time to move on, accept the results of the election, and actually get to work on finding solutions to real, tangible problems facing Americans.
Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats chose to open an impeachment inquiry based on information they haven’t seen and a source they do not know. Just last week, they wanted to impeach Justice Kavanaugh, so this must be their latest ‘impeachment of the week.’
The facts simply don’t support their baseless accusations, but they aren’t concerned about that – they want to impeach @POTUS by any means necessary.
From the day President @realDonaldTrump was elected by the American people in 2016, Democrats have pursued every avenue they can think of to remove him from office – and even their most imaginative efforts have come up empty.
BE ADVISED: Following PG&amp;E's public safety power shutoff last night due to weather conditions that presented a high fire risk, a 2nd shutoff may occur Tuesday night, including Butte, Nevada, &amp; Placer counties.

Stay tuned for further updates as weather conditions are monitored. https://t.co/vgEjhvoKiA
