However she is wrong to believe trying to make marginal improvements will provide any credibility to their efforts. That was lost when they began this whole meritless impeachment charade.

RT @dcexaminer: Never before in our history has the House pursued an unsanctioned impeachment investigation of a president.

Impeachment ha‚Ä¶RT @Never before in our history has the House pursued an unsanctioned impeachment investigation of a president.

Impeachment has soiled the waters of bipartisanship and it seems unlikely Democrats will quit playing politics any time soon.

This National Forest Products Week, we celebrate our workers who are best-equipped and most invested in protecting our forests and natural resources.

Farmers are the best stewards of their land, as it impacts their livelihood, not a government regulator who thinks they know best.
They have a small body of water on their farm and they take great pride in taking care of it. Regulations, like the Waters of the United States rule, which tried to regulate any bucket of water on our farms, makes no sense.
I visited Spring Creek Farms and met with Josh and Kayla Wisdom! It‚Äôs just the two of them on the farm, along with their four children. They sell local, grass-fed and pasture raised meats along with some produce! https://t.co/MoHh069C71
I support all methods of eradication when dealing with this growing issue because of the first-hand accounts I hear from farmers about the destruction from these pests of their land and property.
I visited Ross Farms in Carter County and met with Randy Ross. Randy has been farming for 38 years and uses rotational grazing on all four of his farms. I got to see his farm and speak with him about the problem he is having with feral hogs invading his land. https://t.co/KhF9JFZ7am
I am glad to see that they have recovered and are continuing to build back and grow! Agri-tourism is a huge driver in southern Missouri and it is important we support folks who are attracting tourists to our area and helping our local economies.
I visited Cross County Trail Rides in Shannon County and met with Jim and Jane Smith. During the flooding in 2017, the water reached the roof line of their house. Thankfully, they were rescued by their grandsons who had to pick them up in a boat. https://t.co/CzVpJerWAT
We need to be listening to farmers and helping smaller businesses grow and prosper instead of holding them back with overbearing regulations.
I spoke with Darin Hampton, who owns the farm, about the current rules and regulations that are in place. We discussed how the federal government should never be the biggest obstacle when a small business like his is just starting out and trying to make it.
It was great getting to visit Front Street Farms in Piedmont with State Representative @cdinkins! I got to see their self-service store and the greenhouses where they grow their produce. https://t.co/CNvB2XEzAK
I got to speak with them about the rising cost of health care and how it is impacting farmers in Missouri. We need to lower the cost of care to help Missourians keep more of their own money.
I had the pleasure of visiting Stark Farms in Iron county with State Representative @cdinkins! We got to meet with Art and Margaret Stark who have owned this farm for 50 years. https://t.co/Y0NRqWTaVZ
We got to discuss the challenges that Missouri farmers are facing with feral hogs destroying land and crops. We need to be using an ‚Äúall of the above‚Äù approach so we can eradicate these pests.
I visited Kranjec Valley Angus Farms in Marquand! I met with Ivan Kranjec, the owner, who immigrated from Croatia 50 years ago and has owned this farm for 32 years. He sells angus bulls and show-me select heifers. https://t.co/0LCgGijhNM
It was interesting to see how many elk he can raise in a small area, but also hear about some of the rules and regulations they face at multiple levels of government. We need to allow farmers to do what they do best, farm. And keep government out of their way!

My prayers are with the victims and families in El Paso, Texas as they deal with this senseless tragedy. I‚Äôm grateful for the brave first responders who risked their lives to save others today.
I saw how they sort and process their rice and learned about the techniques he uses to preserve and conserve his land. I have always said farmers are the best stewards of our land and environment because it directly impacts their livelihood.

Under President Obama, I would not have invited the EPA Administrator to southeast Missouri, in fact, I called for eliminating the EPA, but all that has changed under President Trump‚Äôs leadership. I invited EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler to come to Missouri... https://t.co/T5q3sfulbm
The previous administration wasn‚Äôt interested in taking advantage of Missouri resources and workers-they were fine to outsource mining to other countries. President Trump is working to fully utilize the resources we have right here in Missouri.
I had the pleasure of visiting the only primary cobalt mine currently operating in the country, and it‚Äôs right here in Fredericktown, Missouri. I invited EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler to come down and see what Missouri is doing to provide resources to the country. https://t.co/MIlLb4SfRm
I visited with the Knowlan family on their farm in Burfordville. I saw their extensive orchard, cattle and the hoop house that they built with a USDA grant.

I had the pleasure of meeting with the Johnson family in Sedgewickville to see their soybean field. I spoke with them about repealing the Obama era Waters of the United States rule and other regulations. I am working to keep Washington out of Missouri and off your farm. https://t.co/6II0zXHbbC
that will benefit dairy farmers in Missouri. We need to help level the playing field and increase global access to Missouri dairy.

I stopped by Tri-Pointe Farms in Hillsboro and met the Althoff family! They raise cattle, hogs, and poultry and even sell some of their livestock to Chipotle and Whole Foods. They built their farm from the ground up and we spoke about the benefits of raising a family on a farm. https://t.co/d51CVViAKm
and introduced legislation which repeals it. Farmers know and already do what‚Äôs best for their livestock without Washington telling them how to do their jobs.
The family is concerned with the Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) and how it has created an extra hurdle for them to get antibiotics for their sheep. The VFD is a frustrating regulation that I have heard about before and is why I have advocated for its removal
I visited Nature Lane Fiber in Steelville today. I met with the Counts family and talked with them about the sheep they raise for wool, which they hand-sheer and hand-spin. https://t.co/jZSmhFsPUV
Additionally we discussed how access to affordable health care impacts self-employed families. We need to lower premiums and expand Health Savings Accounts to help family farms.

Today we see again how the Left is wasting the American people's time as they continue to prolong their failed impeachment narrative. Special Counsel Mueller's report was released months ago showing no collusion. Yet we are still spending time on this topic. It's time to move on.

Cities like San Francisco use federal tax dollars to improve their roads, highways and bridges while at the same time breaking U.S. law by protecting illegal immigrants.
Missouri taxpayer dollars shouldn't go to cities that actively break federal immigration laws. I introduced the No Transportation Fund for Sanctuary Cities amendment to stop federal highway funds for sanctuary cities.
What a great victory for the rule of law! If sanctuary cities can't follow federal laws meant to keep American's safe then they shouldn't get our federal tax dollars. https://t.co/yThte6hHnd

Enough is enough, @realDonaldTrump tweet was not racist, and neither are his intentions. Like me, he is proud to live in a country where with hard work and humility, you can improve upon the circumstances into which you were born,
Those making a choice to now interpret tweets from @realDonaldTrump as racist are the same who have tried to stand in the way of his policies at every step. They are choosing to further a falsity they have pursued since the day he was elected President.
refused meetings with him, wasted months scrounging for his tax returns, subpoenaed hundreds of his advisors, held his Cabinet in contempt, and called for immediately beginning impeachment proceedings.
Since the day @realDonaldTrump entered the oval office, the playbook from the Left has been to distract, divide, obstruct, impede and impeach. They refused to show up to his inauguration, tried to cancel his state of the union speech, prolonged a wasteful collusion investigation,

Praying for the families of those who lost their lives and everyone across Missouri affected by the devastation and destruction of last night‚Äôs violent tornadoes. Thank you to first responders and emergency personnel who worked through the long night. We will recover and rebuild.

Great news for veterans ‚û°Ô∏è The U.S. House just passed the Veterans‚Äô Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act. 

It increases compensation rates for veterans with service-connected disabilities, making sure veterans who put themselves in harm‚Äôs way get the benefits they deserve.
Hearing reports of tornadoes and severe weather in southern Missouri. Please stay safe and pay attention to local weather reports before leaving the house.

Tomorrow the House Budget Committee is holding a hearing on a government takeover of the health care system. Quick reminder ‚û°Ô∏è This would cause more than 3 MILLION Missourians to lose their current health insurance while adding more than 30 trillion to the national debt. https://t.co/oHstgkwhJO
Our allies in Israel deserve more than empty words of support. They deserve a vote on the anti-BDS legislation that has sat on @SpeakerPelosi‚Äôs desk untouched for three months.

Never let anyone tell you you're too young to make a difference.

The Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement aims to delegitimize Israel and its right to exist. 

Today I signed the discharge petition to force a vote on countering this ugly movement.

We should support our strongest ally in the Middle East, but @SpeakerPelosi refuses to act. https://t.co/8FxALD7BcV

Every minute Congress spends going after President Trump and his tax returns is a minute wasted for American families. We need to work on real issues to help families instead of relentlessly attacking the president and weaponizing the tax-writing committee for political purposes. https://t.co/3ifI75Dfvu

The flawed Paris Climate Agreement lets China and India off the hook for a decade while hampering the U.S. economy. @realDonaldTrump taking the U.S out is the right call.

We already lead the world in reducing emissions, more than entire EU combined.

This year I celebrated with Sam Stolzer, Ste. Genevieve and Andrew West, Cape Girardeau who will attend the US Naval Academy; Allie Gibbs, Cuba and Garrett Marshall, Steelville who will attend West Point; and Madison Manion, Park Hills who will attend the Air Force Academy.

The U.S. shouldn‚Äôt enter unfair international ‚Äòdeals‚Äô that harm our economy.

@HouseDemocrats are trying to force the U.S. into the lopsided Paris Agreement without considering Americans losing jobs as a direct result and that‚Äôs why they blocked my simple amendment last night. https://t.co/jOzd7ntmQy

Special Counsel Mueller‚Äôs report has delivered the final nail in the collusion coffin. Anyone who pushes the false collusion narrative after today is playing into Russian hands to divide our country and cast doubt on our elections. The case is closed; it‚Äôs time to move on.
