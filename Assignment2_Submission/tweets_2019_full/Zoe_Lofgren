I hope that because of his status as a public figure we can shed further light on DHS policies and procedures and that She‚Äôyaa can appear as a witness before the Immigration Subcommittee to help draw attention to these issues. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/szbTfkMkXi
Was his arrest in response to his Constitutionally protected speech? It looks like that. If so, that cannot be tolerated in a free society.
Recently he released a song criticizing the activities of the DHS in its treatment of immigrant children at the border. It was just a few days later that ICE chose to arrest him.
And as a successful artist, he is able to give voice to the views of so many Americans who are critical of Trump Administration policies, activity that is protected by the First Amendment.
As it appears he poses no danger to society nor does he appear to pose a flight risk, questions arise as to why this individual remains in custody rather than released on bond while his immigration case proceeds.
I am closely following the case of She‚Äôyaa Bin Abraham-Joseph aka 21 Savage. His detainment brings into question POTUS's policies to initiate drastic enforcement actions that interfere with individuals' ability to follow the law and to obtain legal status https://t.co/jJcfBpbj7d
