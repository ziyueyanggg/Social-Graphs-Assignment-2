@realDonaldTrump @SenRickScott In regards to the Born Alive Act: The Act would require medical personnel to actually try to save a baby’s life if it is born alive during a botched abortion attempt. This is an issue of right or wrong. What we do about an issue like this says a lot about who we are as a nation.

@realDonaldTrump In regard to cost of medical care: I am glad to be working with @SenRickScott to combat the issue of surprise medical billing. I’ve experienced this issue myself and we have to do better. Times of emergency should not equate to surplus medical feels.
In regard to the impeachment inquiry on @realDonaldTrump : It’s clear to me that there is a presumption of the president’s guilt. We’ve gone from collusion, to obstruction and now this. It’s time to serve our constituents, not our political motives.

For a party that spends so much time talking about the ways in which they believe President @realDonaldTrump  violates rules and precedents, they certainly don’t care to follow them in their political #impeachment investigation against him. (4/4)
However, Speaker Pelosi unilaterally directed committees to begin an official impeachment inquiry. (3/4)
Specifically, “Under the modern practice, an impeachment is normally instituted by the House by the adoption of a resolution calling for a committee investigation of charges against the officer in question.” (2/4)
Today Democrats made clear they have no intention of following long-standing House Practice regarding #impeachment inquiries. (1/4)

Great morning at Coca Cola, and now a fabulous lunch with World War II hero Warrant Officer Randall Edwards celebrating his 102nd birthday. Thank you Sir for living a life worthy of following.
We had a Motion to Recommit that would have amended the minimum wage bill &amp; exempted small businesses who retain fewer than 10 employees or whose annual gross income is less than $1,000,000 from these job destroying wage hikes. Only 14 Dems voted to protect small business.
Last night we authorized appropriations for FY20 intel &amp; related activities. Today we'll vote on some real bad legislation that wants to double the min wage and reverse most of the gains our economy has had the past 2 yrs. My thoughts can be found here: https://t.co/wbjjhLDlmm
Glad to vote yes on H.R. 748 Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019 to permanently repeal the 40% tax-hike on “high-cost” health benefits, known as the Obamacare Cadillac Tax. Big win for families and small businesses.
I'm currently sitting in a T&amp;I Aviation Subcommittee Hearing on “State of Aviation Safety" and hearing from NTSB, a family tragically affected by the 737 Max, and others. https://t.co/b04FVHLoGl
My job is to ensure the nation's safety &amp; prosperity. I voted No on H.Res.489 as the tweets distract from more critical issues. The Dems are playing politics &amp; I don't support their efforts to take down @POTUS. I ask my colleagues to treat one other w/respect &amp; seek common ground
Repubs made a Motion to Recommit NDAA to give troops the resources to strengthen our nat'l defense. Includes 4% pay raise &amp; reverses cuts to readiness &amp; training pgms to reduce accident rates. Dems need to stop internal squabbling long enough to support troops &amp; defend country.
NDAA vote is coming. I love our troops and because I do, I can't pull the trigger on more bad legislation that falls short of what they need and have asked for. https://t.co/2xx7dlnHHU
Yesterday, one of my colleagues asked for unanimous consent for the House to consider the #BornAliveAct . For the 68th time, House Democrats said "no" to mandatory medical care for children born alive. Today, Democrats will get another chance.

This week we'll be looking at the NDAA. What do we know about it? It's less than our mil leaders asked for while slowing readiness &amp; modernization plans and rejects key deterrent initiatives that help ensure security. More bad legislation from a fractured Majority.
After a day's worth of unnecessary drama, the House has finally adopted the Senate bill. Why must issues we agree upon be turned into political games week after week after week?
There are 50+ reps in line w/me &amp; all want same thing: "I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker’s table HR3401 w/the Sen Amendment thereto &amp; concur in the Sen Amendment. This bipartisan bill passed the Sen w/84 votes &amp; could be sent to the Pres's desk for his sig today”
It's  PTSD Awareness Day. Many vets are suffering in silence, often diagnosed &amp; unaware of the psychological effects of combat. I urge you to reach out to those from trauma, offer an encouraging word &amp; prayer, but pls engage. Neighbors helping neighbors is a great place to start.
Senate voted down HR 3401 that passed last night on mostly partisan basis. House Dem's bill is dead. Then the Senate passed bill for $4.6B in humanitarian aid for the border 84-8! Time for our Speaker to allow a vote on this bill, which received votes from over 80% of Sen. Dems.
Proud to support our courageous Coast Guardsmen with a vote to bring them in line with the other military branches as it relates to continued pay through periods of gov't shut down. Cosponsored HR 367 as one of my first acts in Jan and will continue to stand with those in uniform
https://t.co/BPx85Ok0a3
I'm being asked to vote on a $383B pkg for 5 approps bills that are $176B above current caps. There's still no FY20 budget, which could lead to sequestration &amp; devastating cuts to our military. This has ZERO chance to become law! When will we have a genuine bipartisan effort?
Today’s sanctions follows the recent aggression by the Iranian regime. This proportionate response against their leaders should discourage their pursuit of nuclear weapons &amp; support of terrorism. TY to our brave service members on MacDill AFB and elsewhere charged w/this mission.
Good news for many Floridians on the job front: 17K new jobs in May, 215k new jobs in past 12 mos, and unemployment rate down to 3.4% (below national rate). A strong economy is making a huge difference for thousands of our neighbors. https://t.co/Q4HPA2eIGO
