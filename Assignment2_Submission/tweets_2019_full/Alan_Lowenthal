The 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force was signed into law 18 years ago. We need to need to repeal it. Congress needs to restore sanity and restraint to our foreign policy. We can end the forever wars.
Whatever government forms in Israel, it is vital that Congress take a clear stand for a two-state solution: a Jewish and democratic state of Israel and a state of their own for the Palestinian people.

Homelessness is a human tragedy and we must do more to fight it every day. This statement, on the other hand, is callous and disgusting. https://t.co/ctDkMtw9ML
This is an outrageous attack on our climate, and on California‚Äôs right to protect the health and wellbeing of our citizens. We will see the administration in court, and we will win. Their crusade against any and all environmental protections is appalling. https://t.co/rytD8mAqro
Congress has not authorized a strike on Iran. We must act with restraint and in careful coordination with our allies.
It was a pleasure to join @CongressmanJVD and talk with commercial and recreational fishers in Cape May, New Jersey yesterday. Fisheries must be kept in tact and protected as we consider offshore wind development in our federal waters.
More and more voices from around the country are demanding that the Senate act on gun violence. The House has passed sweeping measures, and it poised to do more‚Äîbut Sen. McConnell continues to block all proposals. Its time to stand up to the gun lobby! https://t.co/7sI5qkLRox

We can help ensure that no one who works full time is forced to live in poverty. I proudly voted with my colleagues to raise the minimum wage to $15, but the senate must act!
Today, we mark 25 years since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. The legislation was a historic step in the campaign to end domestic violence once and for all‚Äîbut it must be reauthorized by the Senate immediately.

John Bolton was unfailingly hawkish and deeply radical, in an administration which has been unable to conduct itself effectively. I can only hope that the next National Security Advisor acts to promote peace and stability and tries to restore sanity to this administration.
