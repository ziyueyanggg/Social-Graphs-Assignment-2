One year ago today 11 people were massacred for being Jewish while praying at the #TreeofLife
Synagogue. Today we remember those we lost. Anti-Semitism is real and active in our country, but we are stronger than hate.
Gratitude to our well-trained &amp; accomplished military &amp; national security professionals, as well as our allies, for bringing Baghdadi down. The world is grateful for this barbarian’s end. Hopefully, this brings some relief to the families of his victims.

Just voted to cancel President Trump's "national emergency" and block him from talking money from our military to fund his unnecessary border wall. Our servicemembers and their families should not be pawns in political fights, especially just to satisfy a campaign promise.
President Trump is diverting tax dollars from our military for an unnecessary border wall just to fulfill a promise to his base. Congressional opposition is bipartisan because it hurts our servicemembers and their families, our national security, and violates the Constitution. https://t.co/gUC0TRJg37
Considering the threat to our national interest and national security, I would think my Republican colleagues would be natural allies.
I call on my Republican colleagues, especially those who have privately expressed exasperation with the President, to join with Democrats and protect the integrity of the office of the Presidency and our democracy.
The Director of National Intelligence has refused to send the whistleblower complaint to Congress as required by law.

It has always been my approach to be as deliberate as possible when facing issues of this importance, especially when looking for unity from across the aisle.
It adds to a growing list of illegal acts abuse of power showing this President does not have either the capacity or the interest to follow the rule of law. The President admitted he made the call, leveraging the power of his office to get what he wanted from a head of State.
It is time to open an impeachment inquiry. To not move forward would make Congress complicit in the President's behavior. President Trump’s actions surrounding Ukraine epitomize his disregard for checks and balances as well as normal practices and protocols.
Delighted to join my colleagues - @RepScottPeters, @RepMikeLevin, and @RepPeteAguilar - in sharing our experiences and priorities with the @SDChamber's annual delegation to DC. I’m glad to see San Diegans are out in force explaining our perspectives in Washington this week! https://t.co/utt6NJxomW

The House just passed the #ClimateActionNowAct, which I was proud to vote for, to block President Trump from pulling America out of the #ParisAgreement. Our children are watching. Their future depends on us. https://t.co/pZuLD2yqkR
@jeremyinbloom @ACLU Hi Jeremy-I'm an original cosponsor of HR 5, which includes my bill to prevent LGBTQ Americans from being removed from juries. Glad to see HR 5 pass the House Judiciary Committee and look forward to voting for it on the House floor!
#HolocaustRemembranceDay is more significant than ever as we confront a rise in anti-Semitism in America. Our nation was founded on freedom, equality, and justice. We must stay true to these values as #WeRemember the six million Jews who were killed because of who they were. https://t.co/WKjGKTboMl
A sign of progress. San Diego is a leader in solar energy. We must build on this success. The House will move to block President Trump from withdrawing us from the Paris Agreement &amp; direct him to create a plan to meet the agreement's goals. #ActOnClimate

My heart breaks to learn about another senseless attack on our community, especially during Passover—a time for families to be together. Hate and violence have no place in our society. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.

I'm chairing a field hearing in San Diego right now on the federal government’s responsibility to protect student veterans and taxpayers from predatory, for-profit institutions that defraud #veterans out of their GI Bill benefits. Watch here.👇

Congrats to Fizzah Arshad from Otay Ranch High School for winning the Congressional Art Contest! Her piece "Make Believe" will hang in the US Capitol Complex. Proud of all the students who participated &amp; happy @SanDiegoHistory will allow all to view their art in Balboa Park! https://t.co/jvbIJlmiBM
Thank you to the @SDChamber for hosting another Congressional Luncheon. It is critical that our delegation continues to have productive conversations like these to ensure we are accurately representing and advocating for the San Diego region. #DCinSD https://t.co/YivnofzfvN
This #EarthDay and every day, we can all help give back to our planet in so many ways - reduce, re-use, recycle, plant a tree, compost, bike, carpool, or take public transit. We all have a role in combating climate change! #ActOnClimate https://t.co/mHgvL4BD9C
Despite the Attorney General’s spin job, the report is a far cry from what he described. It's a call for Congress to take a closer look, which should start with Robert Mueller’s testimony before Congress. No one should think this closes the discussion.

I'm distraught by the flames and destruction of the Notre Dame Cathedral. As the French people declare their hope to rebuild and save its precious art and architecture, we acknowledge their pain and love for all it represents.

@HouseDemocrats are getting things done #ForThePeople. In the first 100 days, we're working on and have passed legislation to protect health care, raise wages, end corruption &amp; gerrymandering, restore voting rights, fight climate change, and protect Dreamers. #100DaysForThePeople https://t.co/9zB2bowwMI
I was proud to be in the fight to repeal Don’t Ask Don’t Tell and I’m proud to work on taking down the #TransMilitaryBan. The ban on transgender troops is not based on science or readiness. It’s based solely on discrimination. #FightTheBan
My office received almost 1,000 of these cards from constituents! Thank you so much for sending them. In a strong first step toward ending gun violence the House passed the bipartisan #HR8, requiring background checks for all firearms purchases. Together we CAN end gun violence. https://t.co/qIHU6vWbdd
The House will fulfill a promise to vote on restoring #netneutrality. A free and open internet is good for consumers and good for small businesses. #SaveTheNet https://t.co/CO4ZZgNL5u
So delighted to join the @SDCYBallet for their final performance of Cinderella. It's so important to support the arts and culture for our next leaders. https://t.co/JdoKIrG7uP
Honored to celebrate with Franklin Elementary School as they commemorated their 90th anniversary. In those years, Franklin has done a tremendous job of educating generations of San Diegans. I look forward to seeing the great progress Franklin continues to make in the years ahead! https://t.co/mth7Bj5Tfh
The Violence Against Women Act is a proven success. The House will pass a stronger and more effective VAWA bill that will help even more women escape violence. #VAWA19 https://t.co/qAqiSI4MrA
Today is #EqualPayDay, which is how much longer a woman with the same level of experience must work to earn the same amount of money as a man in the same job. We can achieve pay equality. Passing the #PaycheckFairness Act - which the House did - is a strong first step. https://t.co/IaXSzP4WPR
Don’t forget about my Office Hours today! https://t.co/9zH28FGUPz
It was my honor to present Herschel Feigelson with the Purple Heart. Despite being shot, he helped fellow wounded soldiers reach safety during the Korean War. My office got his award after a bureaucratic issue delayed it. A grateful nation is thankful for his service &amp; sacrifice. https://t.co/ojlBdmrVXQ
Get ready for Team Davis in Lemon Grove! Have a question or need help with a federal agency? Then come down to my Office Hours. My staff will be on hand to answer your questions and see if we can help. https://t.co/RapHk98rVs
San Diego is a leader in medical research. Investment in this research not only means cures and treatment for millions of Americans, it is also good for our economy. 

https://t.co/ZtH6nKABon
If you work the same job, you should get the same pay. As a cosponsor of the #PaycheckFairness Act, I was proud to vote for #EqualPay. https://t.co/9r5LWlR8Qa
President Trump's #transgender ban is blatant discrimination poorly disguised as concerns about readiness, unit cohesion, and medical costs associated with transitioning. I joined the House in condemning this unnecessary ban on patriots serving their country. https://t.co/xWsFALH8f9
Joined @calstate to discuss the importance of preserving Pell grants, decrease student debt &amp; protect public service loan forgiveness. Also met with the women presidents of CSU, including our very own @SDSU President Adela de la Torre. Women now are a majority of CSU presidents. https://t.co/zm4UplyfAB

After disregarding people with pre-existing conditions, the Trump Administration is now trying take health care away from millions more Americans. I will continue to fight to protect the ACA and lower health care costs.

https://t.co/M0rjpeWhbr
Considering the Attorney General’s bias toward the Special Counsel’s investigation, the American people deserve to see for themselves what is in the report.
One thing is clear, as the Attorney General states, the Special Counsel’s report does not exonerate the President on the serious charge of obstruction of justice. This is why the entire report and all the underlying documents must be made public. #ReleaseTheReport
So happy to join History Makers Chris and Toni and Julie and Jennifer at San Diego History Center. https://t.co/q9ISzjw4gA
Had fun spending time with the kids at Neighborhood Housing Association's Early Head Start and Head Start Programs. These proven programs help kids succeed in school and we must ensure they have the resources to continue their success. https://t.co/gEHmg8H3KS

We identify strongly with our friends in New Zealand at such a tragic and senseless loss of life. Today, as Muslims and people of different faiths gather around the world to pray, we must reject all forms of hate and bigotry.

https://t.co/KlgW1ixFsM
I just voted to demand that President Trump make the Mueller Report public. The American people have the right to see what is in the report. It was their democracy that was attacked.
Congressional interns should be paid for their hard work. It's the right thing to do and my office does it. Internships are the apprenticeships of the political field and students should not be denied these opportunities because they can't afford them.
https://t.co/WVGHigpsrA
Parents and students, who worked hard and played by the rules, anxiously await news of whether they will be accepted into their dream college. How many students during this scandal were denied because an affluent few felt the rules do not apply to them?

https://t.co/V2L9MN9yaR
President Trump’s ban is an attack on the thousands of #transgender patriots who are serving their country courageously. It's based solely on prejudice &amp; bigotry. I'll continue to take steps to reverse this policy of discrimination that undermines our values &amp; military readiness.
Dreamers, TPS, and DED holders contribute every day to our communities and our nation. They are teachers, students, medical professionals, first responders, entrepreneurs, and taxpayers. And they deserve the certainty the Dream and Promise Act will provide. #ProtectTheDream
Every woman has the right to live free from abuse. The bipartisan #VAWA reauthorization, of which I'm a cosponsor, includes new steps to support survivors, improve housing protections, and empower law enforcement. 

https://t.co/t29utJjDp6
A budget must reflect the values of our nation. With cuts to Medicare, education, med research, and other domestic programs that help working families, all the #TrumpBudget shows is how little it values the American people. We need a budget #ForThePeople.
https://t.co/7SuuG4akEh
Outrageous that Trump would try to build his wall on the backs of the men and women who sacrifice for us every day.

https://t.co/z12dq1KjVK
Recently joined my colleague &amp; civil rights icon @repjohnlewis in Selma to honor the sacrifice made by so many for voting rights. #ForThePeople is a power move by the American people to seize the reins of their democracy away from special interests. #HR1

We are already seeing some telecom companies slowing access to the internet. Proud to stand with consumers, entrepreneurs, and small businesses to take action to restore net neutrality protections. #SaveTheNet https://t.co/qZjTOa1rmf
Workers earning minimum wage are long overdue for a raise. @EdLaborCmte advanced legislation to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Next stop, the House floor. #RaiseTheWage https://t.co/NPbovh7mL2
#ForThePeople Act expands voting rights, ends gerrymandering, and cracks down on corruption. Proud that my three bills to end restrictions on absentee ballots, restore election integrity, and let voters track absentee ballots to ensure they're counted are included in #HR1. https://t.co/XMdRRNT4Zc
Honored to join my colleague and American hero @repjohnlewis and other members of Congress for a pilgrimage on voting and civil rights in Selma. And be able to share the struggle for equality and justice with my granddaughter Jane. #FPICivilRights https://t.co/F6oVYkzK7w
This not only impacts our military but jobs and our local economy. He couldn't get Mexico to pay for his wall. He couldn't get Congress to pay for it. Now he's forcing our men and women in uniform to pay for it.

https://t.co/7HQEOLLJdQ
After years of inaction Congress is finally moving to #EndGunViolence. Today we are offering more than thoughts and prayers. We are offering bipartisan legislation to expand background checks to all gun purchases, which I am proud to cosponsor. #HR8 https://t.co/OI2Zga6y1u
With my support, the House voted in a bipartisan manner to protect 2 million acres - 1 million acres of wilderness and 1 million of #publiclands - from mining. This includes California parks such as Joshua Tree, Mojave, and Death Valley. #ForthePeople https://t.co/nTvLI4p1Xh
A bipartisan House voted to uphold the Constitution and end President Trump’s national emergency declaration to fund his border wall. Trump is attempting to bypass Congress and raid funding from our military and military families. 

https://t.co/PFaM6x7KbD
In some countries the most important building is the school. Investing in America’s future generations starts with a commitment to our schools being the most important buildings in our country. I am happy to support the Rebuild America Schools Act to make that happen. https://t.co/JzPUdXjgMd
Ready to mark up #HR1 in committee. I’ll fight any attempts to weaken this key measure. It will increase access to the ballot box, end gerrymandering, and limit the influence of big money in politics. #ForThePeople https://t.co/DmvQXiCLA4
I'm joining my colleagues to block the #FakeTumpEmergency. The Constitution explicitly gives Congress the power of the purse. His attempt to redirect funds from Dept of Defense, especially military construction projects, will hurt military readiness.

https://t.co/VoqxKSDlvD
The #ForthePeople Act will lift up the voices of everyday Americans and includes my election reform bills. #HR1 restores transparency, accountability, and integrity to our political system. Read my editorial.

Relieved there was no loss of life and only minor injuries but a reminder of the potential threat of gun violence. Thank you to San Diego Police Department for their response to protect life and find a suspect.

Proud to be an original cosponsor of the #FAMILYAct to guarantee #paidleave for working families. America is long overdue for national paid leave policy to give families greater work/life flexibility.

Wore white to #SOTU to honor women's suffrage. My constituents hoped to hear how the President was going to raise wages, lower healthcare costs &amp; end corruption. They didn't hear that. Instead, they heard a call for unity but on Trump's terms. That's not how bipartisanship works. https://t.co/3R2vRrvLax

Ten years ago yesterday, President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to protect workers from pay discrimination. I was proud to support that bill and also proud to help introduce today the #PaycheckFairness Act to ensure #equalpay for equal work. https://t.co/fvw1dolhfy
The #TrumpShutdown cost our economy $11 billion, nearly twice as much as what he is demanding for his wall. Trump is running America like one of his bankrupt casinos - wasting money and running up deficits.

Excited to announce I've been named Chair of the Higher Ed &amp; Workforce Investment Subcommittee. I'll work to ensure that college is an attainable goal for students and look at expanding apprenticeship programs to let workers earn while they learn.

While I’m glad the President decided to listen to reason, this could have happened 5 weeks ago thus avoiding the unnecessary suffering by the American people, who don’t want a wall. Top priority now is to ensure fed workers get paid, including back pay.
