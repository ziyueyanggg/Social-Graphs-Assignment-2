.@HHSGov just authorized over $800,000 to 10 community health centers in the 2nd District. CHCs serve more than 240,000 Oregonians in the 2nd District of Oregon. This money will allow centers in Oregon to provide quality care for rural communities.

Yesterday was @smokey_bear's 75th Birthday. Cheers to your 75 years of work preventing wildfires, and here is to 75 more years! Take a second to celebrate Smokey's birthday by learning how you can help prevent wildfires https://t.co/ywXxwj5M28 https://t.co/hwDjNYhiad
Which is why I recently wrote to the Chairman of the @NRDems urging him to move the Resilient Federal Forests Act towards a vote. How much more dirty air and killer fires must people in the West have to endure? It‚Äôs time to get these common-sense policies into law.
We must do more to get our forests back into balance, reduce the risk of wildfire, help them recover quicker after fires, and help our forested communities thrive. The Resilient Federal Forests Act will help accomplish those goals.
Another wildfire season is already upon us. While we have luckily seen a slow start this year, the Milepost 97 fire has consumed more than 13,000 acres and sent smoke into the Rogue Valley. https://t.co/eMT1Ieek8K

We must all stand in solidarity against acts of white supremacy, racism and discrimination and the evil nature of its manifestation in violence. Mylene and I send our prayers and condolences to the people of El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio.
Once again, hate and violence have stricken innocent people going about their everyday lives. The murderer in El Paso should receive quick and certain justice, including any added penalties as a result of his hateful atrocity.
Thanks to @USDOT, the Port of Morrow has received a Marine Highway Project Designation. This designation, and the additional funding opportunities, will help decrease traffic, reduce transportation costs, and bring additional jobs and growth to the area! https://t.co/N7dsoSMZTF
