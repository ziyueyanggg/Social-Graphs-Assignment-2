Great to join Tiziana Dearing on @WBUR to discuss my candidacy for Oversight Committee Chair and recount some of the developments in the impeachment inquiry that have led to the House Resolution introduced today to establish procedures for public hearings: https://t.co/8KiGGdBSMh
The #PACTAct would impose targeted financial sanctions that wouldn't be lifted until Turkey withdraws from northern Syria, prohibit all arms transfers that Turkey could use in Syria &amp; provide a plan to ensure all ISIS detainees &amp; families held in Syria remain under proper custody
Pleased to see the House pass the bipartisan H.R. 4695, Protect Against Conflict by Turkey (PACT) Act, which would hold Turkey accountable for the brutal invasion of northern Syria while protecting America’s national security. #PACTAct
Pleased we passed the Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children Act which extends the definition of a cigarette to include any electronic nicotine delivery system. As tobacco products develop we must update our regulations of their sales to ensure children are protected
After serving our country, too many veterans are experiencing mental health issues, substance abuse &amp; homelessness. #VetTreatmentCourtAct will help provide the counseling, care &amp; support veterans need to address these challenges &amp; more successfully transition to civilian life.
Very proud that Democrats and Republicans came together last night to pass H.R. 886, the #VeteranTreatmentCourtCoordinationAct, which will help ensure our veterans who are accused of non-violent drug-related offenses are put into treatment instead of prison.
Everyone should be able to live independently as long as they want, and the Dignity in Aging Act will help communities provide the necessary support to those who need assistance.
This evening the House passed H.R. 4334, the Dignity in Aging Act, which would reauthorize the Older Americans Act (OAA) - an agency that authorizes funds to state and local programs to ensure seniors have access to food, transportation and other basic services.
Great to join @CNN @AnaCabrera to discuss the successful U.S. Special Forces operation that killed ISIS leader al-Baghdadi in Syria with no U.S. casualties. I also explained the ongoing impeachment inquiry and reviewed the process of the investigations. https://t.co/CeQCCvrRdX
My statement on the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi: https://t.co/0Bg252JKRp
Great to speak with @wbznewsradio to reflect on the life and public service of my friend and colleague Rep. Elijah Cummings. We also discussed the FEMA grants that were recently awarded to twelve fire departments within the 8th congressional district: https://t.co/aELipxf6bc

Wonderful time last night at the Gavin Foundation 57th Anniversary dinner to celebrate the dedicated work and compassion the Gavin Foundation has provided individuals and their families who struggle with substance abuse. https://t.co/3qhfAKTksy
The Corporate Transparency Act would also protect our national security by helping banks to identify legitimate businesses and close financial crime loopholes in high-risk commercial real estate transactions.
This week the House passed H.R. 2513, the Corporate Transparency Act of 2019, which will make it harder for terrorists and traffickers to hide, launder and use their money.
Pleased to see the House passed H.R. 724, the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act this week, which would make animal abuse a federal crime. This is a long overdue bipartisan solution to help take action against animal cruelty in our society. #PACTAct
These malicious digital clips are created solely to manipulate or deceive their audience and we are receiving an escalation of warnings from U.S. intelligence officials that they are an emerging tool for foreign election interference. #SHIELDAct https://t.co/hqUrDAKVAQ
Pleased to see my Amendment to the #SHIELDAct passed yesterday, which would prohibit the use of “deep fakes” within 60 days of a federal elections and establish criminal and civil penalties for their use in federal elections. https://t.co/hqUrDAKVAQ
Today the House passed the #SHIELDAct to protect America’s elections from foreign interference. It’s imperative we take strong legislative action to ensure foreign governments don’t engage in another cyber-attack on our democracy. We must remain proactive to protect our elections
I look forward to hearing from @Ilham_Ehmed, Co-President of the Syrian Democratic Council, and other military and diplomatic experts about this critical issue.  https://t.co/olglkWQsHL
Today at 2pm I will be holding an @OversightDems  National Security Subcommittee hearing on President Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria.  https://t.co/olglkWQsHL
It is shameful that the President has implied it is acceptable to put our men and women in uniform at risk to defend oil, but not to fight for the principles of democracy and human rights in northern Syria.  https://t.co/7M2vcWcQ9y
This morning I joined @CNN New Day to discuss my recent CODEL to Jordan and Afghanistan and the President’s decision to remove troops from nothern Syria and deploy a thousand additional troops to Saudi Arabia.  https://t.co/7M2vcWcQ9y
On our bipartisan delegation I had the opportunity to visit with an Afghan Women’s Special Forces group, along with their U.S. trainer, at Forward Operating Base Moorhead in Afghanistan. 

More information about our trip will soon be released on my website. https://t.co/Uajqk1EgbJ
I hope this will begin a new working relationship with the FAA to ensure these urgent matters are properly addressed. https://t.co/kAT8QFr6ZZ
Last week the Quiet Skies Caucus met with newly appointed FAA Administrator Dickson to discuss our priories and express our displeasure with the FAA’s complete lack of involvement and concern over how airplane noise impacts communities.
H.R. 3 would help reduce drug prices by allowing the government to negotiate prices with drug companies, effectively stopping them from over charging Americans and limit out-of-pocket costs for those on Medicare, employer plans and private health insurance. #LowerDrugCosts
Pleased to see H.R. 3, the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act, was advanced through its committee markup this week and passed on to the full House.
https://t.co/rWLft0vKlb
Congress has remained unified in rejecting this dangerous move and we ask President Trump to reverse this chaotic course of action and implement a thoughtful national security strategy that will strengthen and protect America and our allies.
Today the House passed H.J.Res. 77, a bipartisan resolution opposing President Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Northeast Syria which left our Kurdish partners vulnerable to a Turkish invasion and will allow ISIS reemerge as an international threat.
We asked they immediately heed to the immense opposition they have faced from officials, health experts &amp; community residents &amp; abandon the planned location that sits in a densely populated area &amp; will worsen the health &amp; safety of the residents in the surrounding communities.
Last week @SenWarren @SenMarkey and I sent a letter to the President/CEO of Enbridge Inc. (formerly Spectra Energy) urging them to reconsider the location of the proposed Weymouth Compressor Station.  https://t.co/NGbb9yHbtT

A very solemn memorial service yesterday in Abington to remember the lives of Deirdre Zaccardi and her three children – my sincerest condolences to their family and friends.

I spoke with Tiziana Dearing on @WBUR @RadioBoston about President Trump’s violation of law by asking a foreign government, Ukraine, to interfere with the U.S. election. https://t.co/85NtufOF6B
President Trump’s actions, currently undisputed, are an attack on our Democracy, national security and rule of law, and warrant the commencement of formal impeachment proceedings. https://t.co/JElDsfUD9a
I believe President Trump’s recent actions &amp; statements imploring a foreign government to help take down a political opponent in the U.S. Presidential election satisfies the high crimes &amp; misdemeanors standards in Sec 4, Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution. https://t.co/JElDsfUD9a

Every person should be able to afford their medication, their lives depend on it – it is unacceptable that companies continue to raise drug costs on hard working Americans and its past time Congress put a stop to it. #LowerDrugCosts

The #FAIRAct is imperative to help restore Americans’ rights to seek justice and accountability against corporate wrongdoers in court.

As more Americans are gunned down in senseless mass shootings - most recently in Texas - it is long past time to let the Senate vote on the creation of greater gun violence protections to keep our communities and our families safe.
The House of Representatives has passed two meaningful gun control bills that have been blocked by Majority Leader McConnell for the past six months.

https://t.co/DKHXLcQ8L8
(3/3) Congress has debated and considered several Bills to strengthen America’s gun control laws – it is now time up to take up commonsense solutions to prevent more innocent lives from being taken by gun violence.
(2/3) We are now left with the reality that America has experienced two mass shootings within 24 hours – taking 29 innocent lives. There is a gun violence epidemic being fueled by hate throughout our country and it is well past the time to act.
(1/3) This morning America woke up horrified to hear about another senseless mass shooting that occurred in Dayton, Ohio last night, taking nine innocent lives.  I pray for their families, friends and all those impacted by this sickening act of hate.
(3/3) Congress must take every common sense measure to prevent the use of high capacity weapons and munitions in these mass shootings. We must act now.
(2/3) The people of El Paso have been generous and compassionate in their support for the humane treatment of immigrant families. We continue to pray for their strength and resilience in the aftermath of this horrific act of hate.

This week I spoke at UNITE HERE Airline Food Workers Union Picket Line in support of their fight for a living wage &amp; health insurance.
