Should Democrats continue this obscene charade, they will choose ‚Äòthe Resistance‚Äô over the American people. I urge them to move on. This case is closed.‚Äù
Instead, Democrats called today‚Äôs hearing, which was designed to be a public spectacle and serve as one final, desperate attempt to build support for impeachment and appease a radical leftist base.
The Special Counsel‚Äôs thorough investigation lasted nearly two years, cost taxpayers more than $25 million, and resulted in more than 2800 subpoenas and nearly 500 executed search warrants, yet Democrats refuse to accept the report's conclusion.
Further, while the Special Counsel decided to follow the Office of Legal Counsel‚Äôs opinion regarding charging a sitting president with a crime, he was not prevented by statute from suggesting that President Trump‚Äôs conduct rose to the level of an impeachable offense. He did not.
Ultimately, he concluded in his report that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the President or his staff engaged in criminal conspiracy with the Russian government to influence our presidential election.
Therefore, it was not Special Counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs job to exonerate the President, but rather to determine whether there was or was not sufficient evidence to show the President committed a crime.
‚ÄúThe presumption of innocence is at the bedrock of our American justice system. Every citizen ‚Äî even the President ‚Äî enjoys that right.

In fact, we‚Äôre in our 15th consecutive month where there are more job openings than job seekers, and real wage growth is increasing. Rather, Democrats are pushing this misguided policy, which would undo all of these successes.‚Äù
According to CBO estimates, this legislation could cause the loss of as many as 3.7 millions jobs, and reduce family incomes by $9 billion. Republicans have fought to make the economy strong and the job market great for workers.
‚ÄúThis one-size-fits-all government mandate would be devastating for many low-wage workers, small businesses, and consumers. It fails to consider the vast differences in cost of living between Berkeley, California and Dodge County, Wisconsin.

The special counsel‚Äôs investigation was free of political bias, and it will be a mistake for my Democratic colleagues to continue pursuing this disproven narrative for purely partisan purposes.

"Just over a month ago, Congress and the President found a way to come together and pass historic, bipartisan criminal justice reform‚Äîthe culmination of an effort I was proud to lead for over a decade.
Washington, D.C.‚ÄìCongressman Jim Sensenbrenner (WI-05) offered the following statement after President Trump delivered his second State of the Union address:
POTUS: "... from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona... Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history." #SOTU
POTUS: Everything that has come since -- our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice -- all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before. #SOTU
POTUS: "Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.  And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:  all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of God." #SOTU
