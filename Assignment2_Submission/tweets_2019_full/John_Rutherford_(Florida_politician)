Yesterday, Amb. Taylor sat down for nearly 10 hours of questioning, yet all we have access to is a 15 page opening statement selectively leaked to the media. Democrats cry for transparency with @realDonaldTrump, but suddenly have no problem hiding info from the American public.
The American people deserve to know what is going on! This secretive impeachment process against @realDonaldTrump is an insult to fairness, a mockery of justice, and a political witch hunt designed to nullify the votes of almost 63 million Americans. https://t.co/W9hFFiyL7I

Local branches of law enforcement have a responsibility to carry out ALL of our nation's laws, not just those which local politicians find politically convenient.
Decisions like Chief Roessler's endanger the lives of officers &amp; illustrate the failures of many bureaucratically appointed police chiefs. Local jurisdictions are far better served by elected sheriffs who have demonstrated a commitment to their communities &amp; the rule of law.

@CDCgov @RepChrisSmith @UofNorthFlorida 6/ It's more important now than ever to impart on younger generations the consequences of hate and intolerance. That's why I cosponsored @RepMaloney's Never Again Education Act, which would provide educators resources to teach the horrors of the Holocaust.
https://t.co/VWcpBPfVYY
@CDCgov @RepChrisSmith 5/ When #veterans pursue higher education, many face challenges using their benefits and connecting with other students. That's why I cosponsored the Veteran Education Empowerment Act, to help colleges create vet centers like the one at @UofNorthFlorida.

I thank the president for strongly and unequivocally denouncing the evil that took place over the weekend. Our nation must come together to heal. https://t.co/pt5JWiR9fc
4/ @CDCgov data shows that Lyme disease is on the rise. Here in Florida, we have 5 different species of ticks that regularly bite humans, which is why I cosponsored @RepChrisSmith‚Äôs TICK Act, to combat Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases.

.@HomelessChange has been awarded nearly $5 million by @DeptVetAffairs to support their work in ending #veteran homelessness in NE FL. On @HouseAppropsGOP I am fighting for resources to organizations providing the personal, wraparound support our vets need in the civilian world.
3/ As a former sheriff, I know the dangers our police officers face every day. That's why I cosponsored @BillPascrell‚Äôs Protecting America's First Responders Act, which provides financial stability to officers permanently disabled due to injuries sustained in the line of duty.
I am very excited to learn that @Mbranham27 of Jax Beach has been appointed by @GovRonDeSantis to serve on the Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Advisory Committee. Her work at the @alzassociation is making a real difference in the fight to #endalz. Well deserved!
2/ I am a cosponsor of @RepStefanik's Canadian Snowbird Visa Act, which will boost our tourism-based economy by allowing Canadian retirees to remain in the U.S. 2 months longer than currently permitted under law. Read more about this pro-growth bill below!

The @HouseGOP agenda paying off for workers of all incomes! "Wages &amp; salaries were revised upward to 5.3% from 3.6% in May year over year. And in June wages &amp; salaries grew at an annual rate of 5.5%, which is a rocking 4.1% after adjusting for inflation."

June marked the 11th straight month that year-over-year wage gains were over 3%. The best part? Wages are rising for those who need it most. In fact, lower income families are seeing DOUBLE the wage growth of the top half of earners.

This $4.5 billion package will help care for unaccompanied minors, provide desperately needed shelter and supplies including food, diapers, and other necessities, and strengthen mission operations for our border agents. This should not be controversial. @SpeakerPelosi must act.
