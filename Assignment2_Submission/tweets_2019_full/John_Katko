This bipartisan bill provides the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers the tools to conduct research and analyze the economic and physical well-being of our coastal communities. https://t.co/IcphxlhFWx
Proud to announce $500,000 in funding for infrastructure in the City of Auburn &amp; to support our region's growing tourism-based economy! https://t.co/tlneKQPrHh
The bill also establishes a task force specifically designed to protect hospitals, which are some of the most vulnerable targets. Too many in our community have fallen victim to robocall schemes and I am pleased to see the House take action against this harmful practice.
I was proud to support the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act yesterday afternoon, bipartisan legislation that strengthens restrictions on robocalling and levies heavy penalties against groups or individuals who violate these restrictions.
My office has heard from numerous Central New Yorkers who have been relentlessly harassed by robocalls. These robocalls are not only a nuisance but also present significant security and financial threats.
I am a staunch supporter of equal rights for people with disabilities, opposing efforts in Congress which would rollback core protections within the ADA that ensure fair access to public facilities and businesses for individuals with disabilities. https://t.co/iWosa6nqjR
This afternoon, Central New York advocate organizations gathered at Syracuse City Hall Commons Atrium to celebrate the 29th year of the ADA.
This week is the 29th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, landmark legislation that protects the rights of those living with disabilities in communities across America.
I recently joined a bipartisan group of Representatives for the “Legislating from the Middle” panel to discuss our efforts to pass meaningful policies and break through Washington partisan gridlock. https://t.co/2zOVexKyWv
In Congress, I continually reach across the aisle and work with my Democrat colleagues in Congress to tackle pressing issues facing our nation.

I was proud to lead a bipartisan letter with @RepStephMurphy and 31 Representatives urging Congressional leadership to address the looming debt ceiling and reach an agreement on federal spending levels. https://t.co/oBmNS4hweo
Failure to act on these items would be unacceptable for our constituents and carry devastating consequences for the physical and economic security of our nation.
Congress must take swift and deliberate steps to provide appropriate funding for government operations, while also addressing the impending debt ceiling and budgetary spending caps.
Central New York sent me to Congress to focus on governing, and we need to get back to doing the work of the American people.
Our nation faces a multitude of threats and challenges internationally, and countless domestic priorities like the heroin crisis, devastating rates of suicide, and access to quality water remain unaddressed.
We have nearly hit the nation’s debt-limit once again, and are potentially just weeks away from another shutdown.
These resolutions are a political exercise pure and simple, and until they are applied consistently they don’t deserve to take the time of the House.
When a House Democrat made blatantly anti-Semitic statements, Nancy Pelosi wouldn’t bring a resolution to the House floor condemning that member, or anti-Semitism specifically.  But, today, this resolution was rushed to the floor.
I stated clearly yesterday how I felt about the President’s tweets, and I’ll state it again now: I believe they were unequivocally wrong and below the office he holds. However, today’s resolution was just the latest in a string of meaningless votes to score political points.
I voted no on today’s resolution because I am tired of the kind of politics the resolution represents.
Fort Drum is an asset to America’s national defense and the economy of Upstate New York. I was proud to work with @RepStefanik to designate Fort Drum as a preferred East Coast Missile Defense Site and applaud her tremendous leadership on this issue.  https://t.co/3A503cPgvK
The President’s tweets were wrong.  I have vehemently criticized lawmakers on the far-left when I disagree with the direction in which they want to take the country – but criticism should focus on policy.
In Central New York, vulnerable children experience food insecurity and loss of reading skills during the summer months. I joined @RepJoeMorelle to introduce bipartisan legislation enabling at-risk children to enjoy quality meals while advancing education between school years. https://t.co/5e8gM6AVS6
