Proud to be a part of this bipartisan effort to address the ag labor shortage. The bill offers earned legal status for the existing workforce and modernizes guest worker programs.  

This is a big deal and a major step toward reforming our immigration system.

This is a win-win-win for everyone. #FutureFarmWorkforce
