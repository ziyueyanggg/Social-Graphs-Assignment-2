I’m proud to serve in a body that voted to defend this landmark law on Day 1 of this session. We will keep defending the ACA. We will keep working to lower the cost of health care for all Americans. We will keep pushing forward #ForThePeople.
The #ACA extended quality health care coverage to more than 565,000 Washingtonians and strengthened health care consumer protections for millions more. That progress could be reversed if Republican AGs and the Trump Administration succeed in this case. https://t.co/AJDB4q8vZH

Since Trump first met Kim, North Korea’s nuclear program has grown. Now, he has again aggrandized a ruthless dictator, for nothing in return.

He has been played by Kim. Again.
#ICYMI: I’ve known Krista Linden of @StepbyStepNews for many years and have always been inspired by her passion and tenacity. I’m looking forward to seeing the organization continue to grow and help more pregnant women in our community.
