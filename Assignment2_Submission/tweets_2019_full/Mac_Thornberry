"I think it is very important that we never do anything to diminish the importance of the mission that Sgt. Meddock and others have given their life for over the last 18 years because what they have achieved is remarkable."
"We can never forget the human sacrifice, the human cost, that goes into keeping us safe and free.  Sgt. Meddock was one who gave everything he had."
"On Sat, my wife &amp; I had the opportunity to attend a memorial service of the most recent member of our military who was a casualty in the war against terrorists.  Army Ranger Sgt Cameron Meddock was killed a couple of weeks ago in Afghanistan on a very important mission."
"And it is my view, as others have written, that the number one lesson of the last 18 years is that is we let up pressure they will spring back and spring back quickly."
"We have certainly had terrorist attacks here and abroad, but I also think it is important that we pay tribute to our military, intelligence community, and law enforcement for the remarkable success that they have had in the years since 9/11."
As one of the few members left on this committee who was here during 9/11, I never expected us to go nearly 18 years and not have a repeat or that sort of instance.

"Under administrations of both parties and congresses of both parties we obviously aren't providing for adequate resources for border security because we keep having to use the military to back up #BorderPatrol."
"I do have concerns that the broader issues related to the #Immigration debate, that are not the purview of this committee, may be brought into this room even though we have no jurisdiction and even though it threatens to begin this year on a more partisan and contentious note."
"In my view, it is perfectly appropriate for our committee [@HASCRepublicans] to examine the mission and the activities of our military at the southern #border."
