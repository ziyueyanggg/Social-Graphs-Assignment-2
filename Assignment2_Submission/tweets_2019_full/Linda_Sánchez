Latinas continue to comprise a greater share of our country‚Äôs workforce, in addition to raising kids and caring for loved ones. We need adequate paid family leave as part of an effort to close the gap.

Proud to join the CHC‚Äôs Women‚Äôs Taskforce in advocating for these principles. https://t.co/pAGQSaaABv
We all stand on the high heels of the women who came before us. Cokie Roberts gracefully paved the way for many women in journalism and politics. 

As a fan of the Ask Cokie segment of NPR, I‚Äôll miss your insights and charm. Rest in peace.
The Trump administration‚Äôs public charge rule not only promotes a culture of fear and distrust of government within immigrant communities, it puts the health and well-being of immigrant families and children at risk. It‚Äôs time we #ProtectFamilies by saying #NoToPublicCharge.

For the first time in over 20 years, the House passed a bipartisan bill to require background checks on gun purchases. While the Senate has failed to vote on #HR8, we must continue to pressure Leader McConnell to allow a vote.
El Paso is not only a painful reminder of the devastation that accompanies white supremacy, it‚Äôs also another reason why we badly need to pass commonsense gun control measures. We have to keep weapons of war away from hateful individuals who seek to cause harm. #ElPasoStrong
