If the President wants to solve this crisis, Democrats have repeatedly provided solutions. We will fund healthcare, caseworkers, and humanitarian services to help refugees and our border agents struggling to process them.
A year later, things continue to get worse. Refugees legally seeking asylum at our border are being detained without due process in inhumane facilities. Instead of addressing this as a humanitarian crisis, the President continues to treat it as a law enforcement issue.
The report detailed that the Administration had lost thousands of children with no plan on how to return them to their parents. And it exposed numerous cases of children being sexually abused in government custody.
One year ago, I sent a letter to @DHSgov &amp; @HHSgov demanding answers into the Administration‚Äôs policy of separating children from their families at our border. One hundred twenty-three of my colleagues joined me, and together we forced an OIG report exposing the hideous policy.

90% of all illegal drugs enter the USA through ports of entry‚Äînot through the deserts of our southern border. @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs policies are off the mark. Last week‚Äôs record fentanyl seizure was at a port of entry!
If #America wants to stop the cartels, Americans also need to stop buying their drugs.

@CBP just made the largest fentanyl drug bust in #USA history at a legal port of entry. 

Over 600 pounds of drugs hidden inside vegetables were driven into a checkpoint full of armed police and drug dogs. 

Tell me again how a wall will stop this?

Happy to welcome the most diverse Congress in #USA history! The #American people are counting on us. Let's get to work!
A #TrumpShutdown of the southern border would crush California &amp; Texas‚Äôs economies. Hundreds of billions in business lost. Texas alone could lose a million jobs. 

@realDonaldTrump is taking people‚Äôs lives hostage.
$615 billion &amp; over a million jobs. That‚Äôs what our President is holding hostage by threatening to close the border. He would fire a million Americans over a political promise that won‚Äôt work. 

Just as with his business @realDonaldTrump doesn‚Äôt care who loses as long as he wins.
@SecNielsen this is the second child in a month. What is going on at @DHSgov? Does @HouseHomeland have to start subpoenaing you to get the truth?

@ChadPergram Democrats must be included in all negotiations. We must end the shutdown.
Latest on the shut down: President now having lunch with Republican Senators and leaders of Republican Congressional Freedom Caucus. No Dem participation.
@realDonaldTrump publicly said he‚Äôd welcome a government shutdown. This is no way to lead our great nation.
@SecWilkie - The passage of the Farm Bill means #CBD is now legal. @DeptVetAffairs needs to start researching how this new medicine can help vets living w/ #TBI &amp; #PTSD. Let‚Äôs get to work for our #veterans.
The young migrant girl who died in @CBP custody was a casualty of the President‚Äôs obsession with building an unnecessary border wall instead of investing in the resources &amp; training CBP needs. @DHSgov leadership must be held responsible.
