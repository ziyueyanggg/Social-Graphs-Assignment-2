If the President wants to solve this crisis, Democrats have repeatedly provided solutions. We will fund healthcare, caseworkers, and humanitarian services to help refugees and our border agents struggling to process them.
A year later, things continue to get worse. Refugees legally seeking asylum at our border are being detained without due process in inhumane facilities. Instead of addressing this as a humanitarian crisis, the President continues to treat it as a law enforcement issue.
The report detailed that the Administration had lost thousands of children with no plan on how to return them to their parents. And it exposed numerous cases of children being sexually abused in government custody.
One year ago, I sent a letter to @DHSgov &amp; @HHSgov demanding answers into the Administration’s policy of separating children from their families at our border. One hundred twenty-three of my colleagues joined me, and together we forced an OIG report exposing the hideous policy.

Tremendous onslaught? Of mostly women/children migrants coming to turn themselves in to authorities to seek asylum?

There's no onslaught. Troops aren't necessary. #SOTU
Immigrants help boost our #economy &amp; bring #innovation. Expelling them only hurts #USA. #SOTU
I brought a #DREAMer to the #SOTU because @realDonaldTrump must be reminded that these individuals are real people &amp; are vital to our country. They deserve protection and stability.
I’ll continue working for the #American people—but #bipartisanship starts with @realDonaldTrump. Are you ready?
@realDonaldTrump praises our #military but cuts programs #veterans depend on. Actions matter more than words. #SOTU
If @realDonaldTrump is serious about investing trillions into #USA #infrastructure, creating countless good paying #jobs that get #Americans back to work… Count Me In. #SOTU
.#Dreamers cannot be used as a bargaining chip for anti-immigrant polices. I hope @realDonaldTrump addresses real solutions tonight. #SOTU

@CBP just made the largest fentanyl drug bust in #USA history at a legal port of entry. 

Over 600 pounds of drugs hidden inside vegetables were driven into a checkpoint full of armed police and drug dogs. 

Tell me again how a wall will stop this?

Last year I led 124 of my colleagues in demanding answers on @realDonaldTrump’s failed Family Separation policy. After reading this report, it is clear @DHSgov is still not prepared to handle the crisis they created. Here is their final report 👉🏽👉🏽👉🏽 https://t.co/0W2z6Wz2LQ
Glad to see Gov. @GavinNewsom prioritizing California’s homelessness crisis. It’s time we get to work and solve this problem for our communities, our constituents, and our brothers and sisters desperate for a second chance and a roof over their heads.

Instead of pushing for a #BorderWall how about we:

1️⃣ Pass H.R. 299 &amp; grant Blue Water Navy Veterans the benefits they have earned.

2️⃣Continue efforts to reduce incidents of suicide among veterans. 

3️⃣Work to fill over 40K vacancies across the @DeptVetAffairs.
I’m on @CNNDUSA to talk about the President’s border wall and government #shutdown. Tune in.
A new day in DC for @HouseDemocrats! @SpeakerPelosi quotes President Reagan and vows support of #DREAMers, while #KevinMcCarthy calls for Trump’s #wall! California Dems leading the way!
Happy to welcome the most diverse Congress in #USA history! The #American people are counting on us. Let's get to work!
A #TrumpShutdown of the southern border would crush California &amp; Texas’s economies. Hundreds of billions in business lost. Texas alone could lose a million jobs. 

@realDonaldTrump is taking people’s lives hostage.
$615 billion &amp; over a million jobs. That’s what our President is holding hostage by threatening to close the border. He would fire a million Americans over a political promise that won’t work. 

Just as with his business @realDonaldTrump doesn’t care who loses as long as he wins.
@SecNielsen this is the second child in a month. What is going on at @DHSgov? Does @HouseHomeland have to start subpoenaing you to get the truth?
Tragic Breaking News on Christmas Morning. I’m working to find out more. This will not go unanswered.

@ChadPergram Democrats must be included in all negotiations. We must end the shutdown.
Latest on the shut down: President now having lunch with Republican Senators and leaders of Republican Congressional Freedom Caucus. No Dem participation.
@realDonaldTrump publicly said he’d welcome a government shutdown. This is no way to lead our great nation.
@SecWilkie - The passage of the Farm Bill means #CBD is now legal. @DeptVetAffairs needs to start researching how this new medicine can help vets living w/ #TBI &amp; #PTSD. Let’s get to work for our #veterans.
The young migrant girl who died in @CBP custody was a casualty of the President’s obsession with building an unnecessary border wall instead of investing in the resources &amp; training CBP needs. @DHSgov leadership must be held responsible.

@CBP wasted $13.6 million taxpayer dollars hiring 2 people. As Chairman of the @HouseHomeland Security Subcommittee on Oversight, I will hold a hearing on this gross mismanagement of funds. What else is @DHSgov wasting taxpayers’ money on?
