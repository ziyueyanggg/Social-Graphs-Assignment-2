This important hearing has provided this subcommittee with tangible solutions that will help to protect our communities from this epidemic. https://t.co/b0nWPj6q0j
#Gunviolence undermines the public health and the public safety of all our communities. This epidemic has had painful consequences for far too many families in Chicago, including my own family. https://t.co/5fXr03WfJf
We have to expand our viewpoint when we think about #gunviolence. 

The Gun Violence Archive defines a mass shooting as four more people killed and/or injured by gunfire. 

Based on that metric, there have been 55 #MassShootings in my district in the last 5 years alone.
Question at today’s press conference: How can the @EnergyCommerce Committee address the issues of #gunviolence?

Answer: E&amp;C is uniquely positioned to address the issue of gun violence on a much broader level...not just as a law enforcement issue but as an epidemiological issue. https://t.co/zqTq5sH1I5
