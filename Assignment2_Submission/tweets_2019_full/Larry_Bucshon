When it comes to preventing these senseless acts of violence, as a physician I believe that it‚Äôs important to treat the disease and not the symptoms. That means as a nation we must prevent individuals from turning to violence in the first place by swiftly and soundly confronting
I join the President and the nation in praying for the victims and their families during this difficult time, as well as expressing my gratitude for the law enforcement personnel and first responders who leapt to action to protect and care for their fellow citizens.
The tragic events this past weekend in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio were acts of cowardice carried out by wicked individuals trying to strike fear in our hearts.

Today should be the end of this partisan spectacle. The American people want their government to focus on solving the problems which are impacting their everyday lives.
Mueller‚Äôs testimony did not go beyond the report that found no evidence of collusion with the Russians and did not find sufficient evidence for the DOJ to charge the President with obstruction of justice.
Today‚Äôs hearings with Director Mueller were nothing more than a demonstration of House Democrats‚Äô obsession with taking down President Trump.
The Restore the Harmony Way Bridge Act will convey the bridge to the Indiana and Illinois Bridge Authorities and remove the federal conditions set out on the bridge. I am glad to see this bill pass the House today.
