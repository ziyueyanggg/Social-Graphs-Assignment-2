Just this week we learned that Facebook continues to allow the Russians to meddle in our elections to boost Trump &amp; attack his opponents. I called on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before @FSCDems &amp; today is the day I plan to get answers on his proposed #BigTechTakeover. Tune in!
Misuse! Manipulation! Discrimination! Criminal Activity! Just a few of Facebook’s egregious offenses &amp; now they have the nerve to launch a #BigTechTakeover in the form of a currency that could rival the U.S. Dollar?! Is it 10 o'clock yet? Mr. Zuckerberg &amp; I have a lot to discuss.
No one is above the law including Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook has allowed election interference, released private data, violated civil rights laws, among other offenses &amp; now they’re trying to launch a #BigTechTakover by creating this mysterious #ZuckBuck? Not on my watch! @FSCDems
Facebook wants to launch a #BigTechTakeover when it continues to serve as #PutinsPlatform to attack our democracy. Clearly the company can’t be trusted. Today I’m using my gavel on @FSCDems to hold the CEO of Facebook accountable. Watch here -&gt; https://t.co/yZ9snDJ5QV

The more we learn, the more flabbergasted we are. Can you believe Pompeo was on the call w/ Trump when he was shaking down Ukraine's pres &amp; attempting to find dirt on Biden? Was Pompeo also involved in hiding transcripts on a classified server? Impeachment will uncover the truth.
Trump has corrupted so many members of his admin. The lies, coverups, shaking down foreign countries &amp; undermining our democracy will be recorded as one of the worst periods in the history of our country, all led by a dishonorable con man. Follow the facts, impeachment on the way
It’s certainly past time for Giuliani's docs/texts to have been subpoenaed by our committees. His brazen lies, outrageous distortions, &amp; attempts to do anything Trump wants him to do have got to be stopped. His unintended revelations will help us solidify Trump's impeachment.
AG Barr is the highest law enforcement officer &amp; the worst. He's supposed to be the people’s lawyer, but he’s just Trump’s puppet. He's been caught soliciting foreign countries' help in undermining his FBI &amp; our Intel agencies. He should be Trump’s companion w/impeachment.
I'm calling on the GOP to stop Trump's filthy talk of whistleblowers being spies &amp; using mob language implying they should be killed. Impeachment is not good enough for Trump. He needs to be imprisoned &amp; placed in solitary confinement. But for now, impeachment is the imperative.
Trump is so irresponsible &amp; so hungry for power &amp; control, he would dare imply that a civil war will ensue if he's impeached. He is dog whistling to his white supremacists to create fear &amp; intimidation b/c he knows he is going to be impeached. He knows he deserves impeachment.
Trump &amp; his sycophants tried to cover up the transcripts re: his phone call to Ukraine's president by hiding the info on a server reserved for highly classified info. It didn't work. They've been caught red handed. Not just thinking about impeachment, impeachment is on the way.
Do you know Trump called the whistleblower, and others who disclosed his impeachable activities, spies and insinuated they should be killed? Trump is a crook and a hoodlum!
One whistleblower and one telephone call can make a difference. Each of us has power, and if we dare to use it, we can change the world.
Shout out to all of the millennials for staying woke and supporting me all this time I've been warning Congress about Trump and why we needed to impeach him. Remember what I've always said: If you fight, you can win!

Today I spoke with @diprimaradio about the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles and the work I’m doing to combat this devastating issue including my bill to provide $13B to end homelessness and tomorrow’s @FSCDems field hearing @CAAMinLA. Listen below: https://t.co/wdos57ttxJ
Yes, the House of Representatives has passed reasonable legislation on background checks. #MoscowMitch refuses to put the bills up for a vote. As reasonable as these two bills are, that's not enough. The entire Congress needs to pass legislation to get rid of all assault weapons.
Americans, please stop tolerating the pain, suffering, and prayers of families, friends, neighborhoods &amp; all caring Americans. Demand the Members of Congress get rid of ALL assault weapons or kick our a--- out of Congress!
I remain shaken following the killings of the 20 innocent children at Sandy Hook in 2012.  I'm still numbed by the fact the NRA owns too many Members of Congress who don't have the courage to tell the NRA to go straight to hell!
The NRA is a right wing, corrupted, killer organization that does not care about the loss of somebody else's children and families.  All they care about is money, power, &amp; holding fear over the heads of this entire country. The NRA must be disbanded!
I'm not letting law enforcement &amp; elected officials off the hook about the constant black on black killings in Chicago. The weapons that are being used must be banned. The police must do a better job, and the community must demand &amp; strongly support the end to gang violence.
There are no words, thoughts, or prayers that can quell the unspeakable horror that has befallen the El Paso community. Shame on #Moscowmitch for taking no action on Dem gun violence prevention bill! Shame on Trump for stoking hatred, racism, &amp; white nationalism. It must end!
Enough is enough. America, when are you going to demand action on guns? Another senseless mass killing by a young white nationalist. Trump, you cannot escape accepting blame for these escalating killings in our country that are motivated by your race baiting!
The El Paso white nationalist terrorist attacked a community w/ a large Mexican &amp; immigrant population. The El Paso terrorist said in his manifesto Hispanics "race mix" &amp; that this is another reason to "send them back." Did his words, "send them back," sound familiar to anyone?
Don't forget, before 2018 midterms, Trump was screaming about immigrants crossing the border to invade the US! He calls them rapists &amp; gang members. He demonizes Muslims, describes cities w/ large black populations as "rat infested," &amp; called African nations "shitholes."
Trump, you called the El Paso shooting an act of cowardice. Trump, you're the coward. You could use the bully pulpit to stop these horrific mass shootings, but you continue racist attacks on Americans. We can't let Senate off the hook. Pass the gun bill! Congress, we can do more!
Once again, the shootings in Chicago have caused more death and more pain. It's passed time for a well organized strategy by law enforcement, backed by the community, to stop these ongoing senseless murders in Chicago.
Trump is consistent in his history of racism &amp; vicious attacks on African Americans, from denying rentals to AAs in the 70s, calling for the execution of the Central Park 5, to denying Obama's citizenship, attacking black women, "The Squad" &amp; now Congressman Cummings and Bmore.
Don't forget, this unpatriotic president was unwilling to fight for his own country, using deferments &amp; bone spurs to dodge military service; refuses to condemn Russia for undermining our democracy; and calls Kim Jong-Un a friend when the world knows he's a ruthless killer.
While he defends these despicable dictators, Trump never misses an opportunity to condemn &amp; slander American cities, women, Members of Congress &amp; even members of his own administration.
This is the most unpatriotic president that has ever occupied the Oval Office. He doesn't care abt anybody but himself. He's earning money on his golf clubs, hotels, &amp; Trump Org deals while skimming Americans' money, &amp; overusing SecretService to protect him on his many golf trips
This is a lyIng president who claims to need a wall to keep out people from Mexico. Yet, these undocumented Mexicans seeking asylum, who he claims are murderers and rapists have been employed by him in his golf clubs, his hotels, and in his homes.
This is an unpatriotic president who claims to support his daughter (who allegedly cares about the plight of women) &amp; yet has dishonored &amp; taken advantage of women &amp; girls, all as he claimed rapist sex trafficker Epstein as his good friend when we now know he raped younger girls.
Congressman Cummings is correct in assessing this president's diversionary tactics and using his vicious attacks and racism to provoke people into fighting one another about racism. We know Trump is a racist. If he never said another word, we know he's the worst racist ever.
Congressman Cummings is a true patriot who fights for Americans every day. He is not a liar. He is not a divider. He doesn't abuse women. Trump needs to understand that people know the difference between him and Congressman Cummings.
The Judiciary members have a good plan to force more info out of Mueller when he testifies before the committee. If this works, this will give us the ammunition we need to start impeachment immediately.
Testimony from the lawyers who worked with Mueller would be additional and supportive information about #45 and his obstruction of justice and collusion with Russia. We can't stop now. Let's go for it! Impeachment is the answer!
Michael Cohen is serving 3 yrs for the crimes that he committed w/ and for the President of the USA. Many are wondering why this case was closed. It ain't over until it's over &amp; it ain't over until Trump is held responsible for all of his crimes. Impeachment first, prison next!
The impeachment question is going to play heavily in the 2020 elections. Over 70 percent of Democrats polled want Trump impeached. Dems have the support. Let's go for it! Let's stop fiddlin' while Rome is burning!
Did Trump call his sleazy friend Epstein terrific and say that many of the women Epstein liked were on the younger side? So, did he know?

No, Trump. The US military did not take over airports in the 1700s. Your ignorance of history &amp; lack of respect for the Constitution, added to your lies, misogyny, fraudulent &amp; racist background has made you an undeniable candidate for impeachment.

Trump, you better know you cannot declare war w/o Congress giving you the authorization for use of military force.  You better not try it.
Trump, is your confrontation w/ Iran a diversionary tactic? Do you believe getting the US worrying about a war w/ Iran will overshadow growing calls for an impeachment inquiry? Trump, you are a dangerous, narcissistic, poor excuse for a leader. You deserve to be impeached.
Trump, so you are placing more sanctions on Iran. You are trying to further provoke Iran so you can strike. You're alienating the other countries who were a part of the JCPOA. How can you expect our allies to join w/ us in a war with Iran?
Trump, we know you are angling for war with Iran. Stop it now. Iran was in compliance with the JCPOA. You and Netanyahu had better not try to take us to war. We don't need it &amp; Israel doesn't need it.
Trump, you started this confrontation w/ Iran. Why did you unilaterally renege on the JCPOA agreement of the US and six other countries to avoid Iran's nuclear buildup?
Trump, you get no credit for so-called stopping the strike against Iran. Why was the unmanned drone in Iran's airspace? Why the surveillance? Don't provoke and then pretend innocence.
#nomorewars This president is up to his old tricks allowing Bolton and Pompeo to be the war hawks while he pretends to be reasonable so when he strikes Iran he can say "I tried not to strike." Real trying is diplomacy. Back off 45!

Trump's campaign chair gave polling data to Kilimnik who was tied to the Kremlin. Manafort, Don Jr, Kushner, &amp; Flynn met w/ Russians during campaign. Collusion is obvious. Obstruction of justice is well defined in Mueller report. Trump said game over. No, the game has just begun!
Putin &amp; the Kremlin are even now interfering w/ our election systems. They were proven to have undermined our 2016 elections &amp; evidence shows they will do the same in 2020 --ALL in support of Trump. Trump won't criticize or stop them. Congress must stop them &amp; #ImpeachTrump!
Mueller kicked the impeachment ball to the Congress. The Constitution gives the responsibility to Congress to impeach an unfit president - "high crimes and misdemeanors." What more do we need? #impeach45
Ninety percent of the calls and mail I'm receiving in my office support impeachment of Trump and so do I. Dems divided. The impeachment resolution must start with &amp; be taken up by the Judiciary Committee. Rep. Nadler is the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
I received some criticism b/c I said Repubs supporting Trump -after his crimes &amp; work w/ Russians - are unpatriotic. Yes I said it! How can you know the enemy Russia is undermining our democracy &amp; say &amp; do nothing? If you don't care, I do. We must impeach Putin's president Trump!

ICYMI: My statement on the release of the redacted #Mueller report by AG Barr https://t.co/b7yjKNTi8E
Barr said the words "no collusion, no collusion" straight out of the mouth of Trump. No attempt to hide his continuing defense of the President using the President's own words. How much more of a lackey can he be? FAKE AG!
Barr auditioned for the job. He said he would protect Trump and that is what he has done. We demand Mueller's public testimony and review of his report NOT Barr's twisted interpretations!
Barr made a point of defending the President by describing Trump's pressure &amp; frustration b/c of criticism. It's not the AG's job to protect a President who refused an interview by the Special Counsel! Barr is simply continuing his ongoing defense &amp; protection of the President!
As I stated last night on MSNBC, the American people shouldn't have expected Barr to do anything more than what he did: protect Trump. Barr has been acting as Trump's defense atty, not AG. Barr's performance was outrageously disrespectful of the Constitution &amp; the American public

For the faint of heart, who've been waiting for every "t" to be crossed and every "i" to be dotted, now is the time to demonstrate your patriotism. Support impeachment!
Trump, you have screamed no collusion and no obstruction of justice so many times, trying to influence others, that I think you really believe your own lies. Just stop it. No honesty. No truth. No trust. No patriotism.
Lying Trump, so you said you did nothing to force security clearance for Kushner, huh? Who do you think will believe that lie? Must give you credit. You are the boldest, most daring liar I've ever heard of.  A pox on all your houses.
Hey Manafort, Cohen, Flynn, Gates, Papadopoulos, &amp; Stone, its truth telling time, and the truth will free your heart and soul -- but no guarantees freedom from prison time.
Obstruction of justice reality show: Firing Comey, sending coded messages to Manafort &amp; others that he has the power to pardon; lying abt Trump Tower meeting; threatening Cohen's in-laws; attempting to destroy Mueller. What more do we need to know? Impeachment is the only answer
The killing with the chainsaw &amp; dismemberment of #JamalKhashoggi by the Saudis is the most gruesome &amp; heartless act imaginable! Now we learned his body parts were burned in a giant oven! Trump, God will never forgive you for siding w/ MBS on this murder.
Lying Trump said he believes killer Kim Jong-un, that he didn't know what happened to #ottowarmbier. Now he wants to flip the script. No one can believe this unworthy president. He is the most prolific, consistent, good for nothing liar this country has ever experienced.

CBS, the efforts on your website about your support for diversity fly in the face of your display of all of the reporters you've selected for the 2020 campaign. Not one Black. What's up with this? An explanation is needed.
Trump, you didn't get $5 billion to carry out your ill advised election promise &amp; now you want to declare an emergency. The only emergency facing our country is the need to impeach you before you destroy our country, our ideals, &amp; leadership in the world. Trump, go home. Bye bye!

No surprise the FBI questioned Trump's allegiance to US! He meets w/ Putin 5 times in secret w/ no readout; gave Russians classified info in WH; disregarded US intel on Russia; praised Putin's election; lies abt his deals in Russia. Is there any question Trump is a Russian agent?
Trump has perfected the art of lying. No, #ConManDon, the FBI investigation hanging over your head is no witch hunt. You are engulfed in a web of lies &amp; deceit. Webs are created by poisonous &amp; dangerous spiders. You fit the profile.
Please. No one should wonder why Manafort gave polling data to Russians. The only reason Russians wanted this info was to use it against H. Clinton in support of Trump. Why do you think Manafort w/ all his ties to Russia &amp; Ukraine was in the campaign to begin with? Stay woke!
Americans should be shaken by what we know of Trump &amp; Putin's relationship &amp; should NOT be surprised by the FBI counterintelligence investigation. Is Trump a Russian agent? If it walks like a duck &amp; talks like a duck, then it is a duck - and the duck should be impeached.
Trump, even your most vocal defenders will turn on you w/ your shutdown when there's no food on the table, the rent is not paid, the car is repossessed, &amp; the children need shoes. No American who works for our govt should be treated this way while you are living off the govt.
