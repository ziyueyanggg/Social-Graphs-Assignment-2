This administration prioritizes the wealthiest 1%, overlooking the majority of Americans. The #PublicCharge rule is NO different! We refuse to allow the values of our Nation to be misrepresented. Join @TheBlackCaucus @CAPAC @HispanicCaucus by saying #NoToPublicCharge.
Of the nearly 26M immigrants that could be denied access to our Nation by this administration's expansion of #PublicCharge, 70% are Latinx - a group @realDonaldTrump has consistently targeted. We must not allow hate to become our policy. #ProtectFamilies
With dog whistle rhetoric like "Go back," freely and openly stated by the President, it is clear how #PublicCharge can be rooted in invidious discrimination. This rule could disproportionately affect immigrants of color. I stand for immigration WITHOUT invidious discrimination.

The suicide of Mr. Epstein is an impossibilty. When an impossiblty occurs involving powerful people and possible criminality there must be an investigation to end speculation. Because the public has a right to know, I‚Äôm calling for a congressional investigation. #JefferyEpstein

Today, we commemorate the life of one of the world‚Äôs greatest humanitarians. Mickey Leland was a stalwart for equality and justice for those often deemed the least, last, and lost. Although we mourn his passing on this day 30 years ago, his legacy transcends time.
Catch me LIVE on @CNN shortly as I discuss the El Paso and Dayton shootings.
Mr. President, if you're going to #ElPaso to save face, admit you were wrong for demonizing Latinos. If you're going to denounce white nationalist terrorism, it's 22 deaths too late. You must do more. If you're going to promote your personal politics, don't go. #DoTheRightThing
Horse-mounted policemen shamelessly parading a Black man handcuffed &amp; hitched to their horse by rope down the streets of #Galveston is bad policy &amp; bad policing. Mr. President, is this what you meant on 7/28/2017 when you told police "don't be too nice" when arresting people?

Because I love humanity, I send my expressions of condolences, sympathies, &amp; prayers to the families &amp; victims of all mass shootings. Because I love my country, I have sent today‚Äôs tweets calling for action to our President. #EnoughIsEnough #DaytonShooting #ElPasoTerroristAttack
Mr. President, because you have dishonored our country by continually promoting white nationalistic hate and because you will not honor our country by resigning from the Presidency, you leave us with but one immediate choice. #ImpeachNow #EnoughIsEnough
Mr. President, condemning the white nationalist terrorists only addresses the effect. You must condemn white nationalism to eliminate the cause. #EnoughIsEnough #WhiteNationalistTerrorism
Mr. President, show some moral leadership: 
1. Condemn the NRA
2. Condemn white nationalism
3. Declare a national emergency
4. Call for Congress to end the August recess and deal with our domestic terrorism emergency

With a majority of House Democrats on board for an impeachment inquiry, the question is no longer who will be among the first to sign on, but rather who will be among the last to sign on to impeach an unfit president. #ImpeachNow
The President‚Äôs shameful comments about Congressman Cummings make it evident that his bigotry is not going away. We can no longer tolerate it and condemnation by the House of Representatives clearly wasn‚Äôt enough. We must impeach. #ImpeachNow
