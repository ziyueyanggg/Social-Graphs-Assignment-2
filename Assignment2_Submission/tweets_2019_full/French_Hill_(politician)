Yielding to Turkey is geopolitically short-sighted and ultimately hurts U.S. foreign policy interests and global security across the entire Middle East and beyond. 
My full statement: https://t.co/qDSPVVJWaX
The invasion by Turkey into Syria is completely unnecessary &amp; withdrawing our troops undermines the ability for the U.S. to cultivate trust of allies in future conflicts. This decision only strengthens Iran &amp; Russia‚Äôs influence in the region &amp; is a death sentence for the Kurds.
People were returning to their villages &amp; trying start their lives over. Now those hopes are dashed &amp; that stability is in tatters. While the Turks have a role to play in the dangerous border region, turning security of NE Syria over to Turkey is not the proper strategy.
Our worst fears are being realized by the standing down of the small group of U.S. military forces in northeast Syria. Our efforts, along with those of our allies, the local Kurds, have provided increased stability in this critical post-ISIS environment.

The story of the Elaine Massacre is one of the darkest and most tragic chapters in Arkansas's history. It has left a profound impact on the soul of our state that can still be felt 100 years later. However, history teaches us that we can learn from our past. (1/2) https://t.co/Py8ffHoAck
America can help save countless lives by passing the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, a bipartisan bill that sanctions the Assad regime and its partners, Russia &amp; Iran. I‚Äôm calling on @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SpeakerPelosi to immediately prioritize its passage and implementation.
This morning, I met with the Syrian defector known as ‚ÄúCaesar‚Äù who risked his life to smuggle out horrific photo evidence of Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs modern-day genocide. His message to me: do not let the 500,000 Syrians murdered by Assad and his henchmen die in vain. https://t.co/qXqBiCbKTZ https://t.co/DtGKFmwP83
If leaders of the free world do nothing and let this modern-day genocide continue, America and our allies will hang our heads in shame for ignoring ‚Äúred lines‚Äù that have become a green light for Assad‚Äôs slaughter of his own civilians by the hundreds of thousands. (7/7) https://t.co/c1aP1Hpkqr

This school has been a ray of hope for the youth of Idlib but had to close its doors due to Assad‚Äôs bombings. Just yesterday, the U.S. Intelligence Community concluded that the Assad regime used chlorine as a chemical weapon during an attack on Idlib this past May. (3/7) https://t.co/TRK7h6nhQI

The list of horrific atrocities committed by Syria's dictator Bashar al-Assad continues to grow. Since mid-August, Assad and his protectors, including Putin and his Iranian co-conspirators, have repeatedly bombed the town of Idlib in northwest Syria. (1/7) https://t.co/xCrPTCjm7B
Earlier this year, I had the chance to meet 24-year-old Omar Alshogre, a survivor of Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs death prisons in Syria. His harrowing story of survival shocked me to my core. Please take a moment to listen to his story directly from @OmarAlshogre.
