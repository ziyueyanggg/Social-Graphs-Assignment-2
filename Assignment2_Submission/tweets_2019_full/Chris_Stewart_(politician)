President Trump must not make the same mistakes President Obama did. I will continue to press the White House to protect our Kurdish allies &amp; security interests in the region.
I disagree with the President &amp; his decision to withdraw troops from Syria. Abandoning our Kurdish allies will have devastating impacts on our national security and potentially allow ISIS to regain control of the region.
Dems have been trying for 3 years to impeach the President. They aren’t “pained” by this. They’re excited. And it’s terribly divisive for the American people.

My sincere condolences to the friends and family of former First Lady of Utah, Norma Matheson. She was a strong leader who devoted her life to the betterment of our state.
Thank you to Dan Coats for his service as the Director of National Intelligence. He has been a great leader and friend. I wish him all the best.

The legislation is vital to helping schools address the rapid increase of e-cigarette usage.
https://t.co/srXaqtnHOO
Introduced the Smoke-Free Schools Act with @RepEliotEngel @HaleyLive. E-cigarettes have made their way into schools across the country &amp; have quickly become an epidemic among youth. E-cigarettes need to be taken as serious as combustible cigarettes &amp; this bill is a great start.
The two-year budget agreement:

✅ provides strong funding for our men &amp; women in uniform 

✅ excludes Democrat poison-pill riders 

✅ ensures taxpayer funds don’t pay for abortions  

❌ Democrat’s prohibition on border wall funds
I’m biased, but I think our office always has the best interns. This summer’s interns were no exception. I’ve been impressed by their hard work and look forward to seeing their future accomplishments! #NationalInternDay https://t.co/OIC7TvdnR3
The house just passed #HR3375, which I happily co-sponsored. This bill will implement a nationwide caller authentication system, free to consumers, to help crack down on those badgering robocalls. A great end to a busy day! Thank you @FrankPallone and @repgregwalden!

The irony of this bill? It hurts the very people it’s claiming to help.

Deeply saddened to learn of the death of Sgt. First Class Elliott J. Robbins from Utah who died serving our country in Afghanistan. My heart aches for his family, especially his wife &amp; baby boy. May his son grow up knowing his father is a hero who served our country valiantly.

As a former Air Force pilot &amp; member of the Intel Committee, what we’re seeing now is very common. It's the give &amp; take of deliberation &amp; exploring all the options. It's adjusting the plan when new info becomes available. It's how important national security decisions are made.
Neither the US nor the International Community can ignore Iran's aggression. As one of the world's most violent state sponsors of terrorism, this falls into a pattern we've seen from them before. I appreciate @realDonaldTrump commitment to a meaningful but proportionate response.
