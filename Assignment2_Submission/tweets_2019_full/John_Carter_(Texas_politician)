I‚Äôm saddened to hear of Rep. Cummings passing. He dedicated his life to service and community. Sending my deepest condolences to his family, friends and staff.
The well being of U.S. troops is my top priority and ultimately, I hope that a diplomatic solution can be reached.  However, if Turkey continues to take military action against the Kurds that jeopardizes the progress we have made, the US should respond swiftly.
Our Kurdish allies have been instrumental in liberating ISIS controlled territory in Syria. While the threat that ISIS poses to the region has declined, abandoning our allies sets a troubling precedent and risks further instability to an area already plagued with civil war.
Bowing to a communist regime that's rife with human rights abuses goes against everything America stands for. https://t.co/yrSPZcTEiY

Meanwhile, the Senate just passed a bipartisan bill, that can become law, to address the humanitarian crisis at the border. I urge Speaker Pelosi to bring this legislation to the floor ASAP, so we can give the agencies the resources they need to take care of these children.
Now Democrats (after a month of obstructing) put forth a bill containing poison pills that they know won't pass, because they'd rather play politics then fix the situation.
The conditions at the border are declining because agencies are stretched to their limits with the influx we are experiencing now. Health and Human Services is overwhelmed and begging for resources. But for an entire month, House Democrats refused to act.
Dems finally offered their own bill this week- a partisan bill that included poison pills like:
‚û°Ô∏è limiting DHS ability to send more personnel to the border to handle influx
‚û°Ô∏è cutting overtime pay for BP
‚û°Ô∏è no funding for immigration judges to handle backlog
Republicans attempted to bring this bill to the floor 17 TIMES &amp; 17 TIMES Democrats blocked the legislation. Meanwhile, Democrats did not offer an alternative of their own to address this humanitarian crisis. After watching the situation escalate for a month...
On June 3rd, House Republicans introduced H.R. 3056 in response to the Administration's request for humanitarian aid along the border. 

It included $4.5 billion total
‚û°Ô∏è $3.3B for humanitarian assistance
‚û°Ô∏è $1.1B for operational support
‚û°Ô∏è $178M for law enforcement pay
