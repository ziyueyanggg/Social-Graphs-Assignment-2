The United States must remain vigilant in our fight against terrorism. While the death of al-Baghdadi is consequential, we must not mistake the demise of one ISIS leader for complete and finite victory.

The success of the al-Baghdadi raid is a testament to the valor and skill of our military personnel and intelligence professionals, and we are grateful for their bravery and patriotism.
Happy #Diwali to all those celebrating the Festival of Lights in America and around the world! May we always bring light wherever we go.
It is also unacceptable that the President has been relentless in hurling a barrage of insults at the Kurds over the course of the last two weeks - literally adding insult to injury. The Kurds have fought alongside us, and if nothing else, they deserve our gratitude and respect.

I personally thank the Kurdish people for all they have done and sacrificed for us in the fight against terrorism. I respect and honor our alliance with them and will do everything I can to try and help them rebuild.
What happened to the Kurds in Northeastern Syria is an abomination. The failure to do everything that we could to prevent the current fate of the Kurds is a betrayal of a key partner and a major foreign policy blunder. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/gkT4dfCRTN https://t.co/Zx8Ad3QKcb

The conditions migrant families and children are living in is a tragedy and contrary to basic decency &amp; human rights. I am proud of my @HouseDem colleagues for visiting detention centers over the last week and continuing to bring to light injustices faced by detained immigrants.
The culture of cruelty displayed by these CBP agents is reprehensible. The reports over the last week reaffirm what we already knew - our immigration detention system needs fundamental reforms that start by recognizing the dignity individuals deserve. https://t.co/Dc6mrUlHF7

Unfortunately, not all adoptees could benefit when the law originally passed, as it was limited to apply only to minors age 18 &amp; under. Adopted individuals should not be treated as second class citizens just because they happened to be the wrong age when the act became law.
