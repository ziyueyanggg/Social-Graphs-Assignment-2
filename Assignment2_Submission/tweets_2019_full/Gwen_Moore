Trump and the GOP have found various ways to jeopardize Americans' access to health care:

✅Efforts to repeal the ACA and cut Medicaid
✅States putting up bureaucratic barriers to Medicaid and CHIP
✅Cuts to ACA enrollment outreach

The Trump Administration’s #PublicChargeRule was written with the clear intent of intimidating and discriminating against immigrants of color and puts the health and well-being of immigrant families at risk. https://t.co/urvyGAWZ2I
Celebrating #HispanicHeritageMonth? Look no further than 35th &amp; Greenfield Artist, Juan Flores, and shop owner, Raul Varela, who created these beautiful Mayan &amp; Aztec prints. Their etchings were made to promote conversation and help bring people together. https://t.co/XFsGlhF2K1
GM should come to the table and negotiate an agreement that protects the dignity of their hardworking employees.
GM and their shareholders rake in billions. Meanwhile the #GOPTaxScam enriched the corporation even more, and workers haven’t seen the benefits. This not what the American people were promised.
I support GM's @UAW auto workers' efforts to negotiate for better pay, health care benefits and job security.
Despite multiple attempts to intimidate Hispanic Americans and our communities of color, everyone can and will be counted in #Census2020. It's more important than ever that ALL of our communities are included in our democracy - your voice matters this #HispanicHeritageMonth! https://t.co/mPh3yPjXwU

The Trump administration is trying to force #Dreamers to live in fear by threatening their legal status. Don’t let them. Two federal court injunctions hold #DACA in effect. If you’re a DACA recipient eligible for renewal, please update your status today⬇️ https://t.co/IoAdi0O0AT
Over the past 25 years, VAWA has improved the ability of the civil and criminal legal systems to address domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It is time for the Senate to pass a VAWA with important improvements for victims. #VAWA25 #VAWA4ALL https://t.co/qjAfaoeBxM
I'm pleased that @GovEvers is working hard to address Wisconsin's lead poisoning crisis especially among low-income mothers and children, who are particularly vulnerable. I will keep working with partners at the federal, state, and local levels to end lead poisoning. https://t.co/2hXuXXevTo
It was great talking with leaders from tribal communities. I welcome a hearing to draw national attention to issues that hinder economic growth in Indian Country. https://t.co/V3Ik3cqGWV
When those fleeing life or death situations used to knock on the door, America would answer. The Supreme Court’s ruling shuts the door of opportunity, safety and shelter for Central American migrants and forces them to fight for their lives alone. https://t.co/UHr1w0re7l
Native women are going missing and need Congress to act on this crisis. I’m proud to support my friend @RepDebHaaland’s legislation to help protect Indigenous women by coordinating missing persons data. https://t.co/5Va7ueJtKy
We need #VAWA reauthorization now. 84% of Native women have experienced violence in their lifetime. I stood with my tribal brothers and sisters to recognize crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women and the need to pass #VAWA. https://t.co/AtWwSnak9x
Honored to preside over today’s @HelsinkiComm hearing on the importance of championing inclusion and diversity in Europe. As overt acts of xenophobia increase globally, it’s more critical than ever to foster these discussions. https://t.co/AtGb8xdKE0

Amid tragedy, their selflessness and courage reaffirmed our nation's values. We will #NeverForget.

The uninsured rates rose in 2018. Disappointing but unsurprising news following Trump &amp; the GOP's continuous attacks on affordable health care, including for those with pre-existing conditions. These are some (but not all) of the Administration’s efforts to sabotage the #ACA: https://t.co/0TPoEhOv2y
The #1619Project commemorates the untold parts of U.S history, and the silence and denial that continue to perpetuate inequity &amp; injustices.

Let us never forget this day.
Today is the 400th anniversary of the forced arrival of enslaved Africans in the British colonies of North America. The history of enslavement isn’t just African-American history, it’s American history. https://t.co/TOH3t2ANMR

Couldn't agree more with @SenatorBaldwin. This only speaks to how out of touch the Trump administration is with Wisconsin farmers.

I joined community leaders &amp; elected officials to discuss the efforts that I, along with my House colleagues have taken to end voter disenfranchisement and strengthen voices that have been marginalized for too long.
Restoring voting rights would empower communities. I was proud to support the House's passage of #HR1, which restores voting rights to those on parole and probation and ends prison gerrymandering to ensure that prisoners are counted in their communities &amp; not a prison's address. https://t.co/jIR8fqLGG2

Wisconsin was the 1st state to provide collective bargaining rights for govt. employees, worker’s compensation &amp; unemployment benefits. https://t.co/EsPHPvV35j
The doula also protects the health of the mother by providing critical emotional and physical support.
A doula plays many roles in a woman’s pregnancy, but most importantly, acts as an educator and a friend. When a woman does not understand her options for pre- and post-natal care, she is at risk. A doula can protect the heath of the baby. https://t.co/GS9w0jXzMd

I asked myself this question and on May 15th, I introduced the #MamasFirstAct, which requires state Medicaid programs to cover doula and midwife services. This bill aims to address our nation's high infant/maternal mortality rates with holistic care to low-income women.
When #BlackBreastfeedingWeek ends, the fight for justice does not. Remember to continue the conversation about #MaternalJustice and ask yourself, how can I support the women in my community?

Dr. King and other activists knew that equality was in America's reach, but Dr. King's dream remains unfulfilled. Their hope and vision should be used as momentum to keep fighting for justice.
In 1955, white supremacists murdered Emmett Till, shocking the nation and stirring outrage. His brutal lynching was a catalyst for the Civil Rights movement. 8 years later, courageous Civil Rights activists demanded justice during the March on Washington.
