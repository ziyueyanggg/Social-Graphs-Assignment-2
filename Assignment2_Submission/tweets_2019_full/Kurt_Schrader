The racist comments made by President Trump about my colleagues in Congress are totally offensive and extremely unacceptable. Comments like this have no place in our country, especially from our Commander in Chief.

I spoke last week in support of the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers that were at risk of being shut down by the Trump Administration. It was just announced that because of strong Congressional opposition these centers will remain open.

The Mueller Report is clear that Russia did interfere in our American election process. It is our responsibility in Congress to protect and secure our elections, a responsibility I take very seriously. The security and success of our democracy demands it.

I voted for the #SaveTheInternet Act to overturn the FCC‚Äôs 2017 order to roll back #NetNeutrality. Oregonians overwhelmingly support enforceable protections to ensure a free &amp; open internet &amp; so do I. Congress must act to codify important #NetNeutrality protections for consumers.

This legislation mirrors Oregon‚Äôs framework and will also ensure tipped workers are paid the same as non-tipped workers. It has been ten years since Congress raised the federal minimum wage and the time is now.
A $7.25 federal minimum wage is indefensible in this day and age. This week, I co-sponsored legislation introduced by Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell to raise the federal minimum wage to $15/hour in our nation‚Äôs cities and take a regional approach in less urban areas.
Congrats to our 2019 Congressional Art Competition winner Hongsheng Chen of Lake Oswego High School! Thanks to all the students who participated for sharing your incredible work. https://t.co/8w2s7g8h9R
