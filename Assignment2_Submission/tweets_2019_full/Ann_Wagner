This is an important step in penalizing scammers who take advantage of consumers and violate their privacy. This bill makes it easier to fine offenders and supports implementation of new technologies to block illegal calls.
Proud to support the bipartisan Stopping Bad Robocalls Act which overwhelmingly passed the House. We have all been inundated with unwanted robocalls that seemingly never stop, and Missourians have been harassed by bad robocallers for too long.
During this week’s Financial Services committee hearing on the proposed merger of SunTrust and BB&amp;T, I questioned our witnesses on whether there is sufficient competition in banking and what that competition might look like a decade from now. Watch here:

I will work with my colleagues to support security and prosperity for the Israeli and Palestinian people. This important resolution passed 398-17.
The BDS Movement only takes us further from peace, and we will continue to condemn this hateful movement. I thank AIPAC for its help in bringing attention to this critical resolution.

They rejected this commonsense amendment that would have prevented funds from being used to limit access to coverage for those w/ pre-existing conditions. I will continue to fight to protect people who have pre-existing conditions &amp; am committed to lowering our healthcare costs.
Protecting people w/ pre-existing conditions is a top priority of mine in Congress. I was pleased to join my friend Rep Rodney Davis in supporting his amendment to protect people w/ preexisting conditions, but unfortunately Democrats continued to play politics w/ health care.

As we recognize the brutal 1989 massacre that China has sought to erase from history, we must continue to combat the regime’s human rights abuses. 
https://t.co/Vyd70LeRBS
Since 2011, China has spent more money on controlling its own population than on defending against foreign powers. According to some sources, China’s annual spending on domestic “stability maintenance,” its police state apparatus, now surpasses defense spending by nearly 17%.
I spoke at a hearing recognizing the thirtieth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. In the years since the brutal killings at Tiananmen Square, human rights abuses and repression of civil liberties by the Chinese Communist Party have only gotten worse.
