As we face challenges and uncertainty around the globe, it makes no sense to turn your back to progress, to ignore the pleas of our allies, and to disregard wise counsel and hard core facts.  The price of peace is persistence, but the cost of war is always too high.
To this very day, experts and allies agree that the agreement was working to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
Iran cannot have nuclear weapons‚Äîbut the United States must be a headlight and not a taillight, leading the world on the path to peace through the hard, necessary work of diplomacy.
Nearly 3 years ago, I supported the agreement after constant study, briefings, and discussions. During the debate on the House Floor, I warned that we could not let the perfect be the enemy of the good in the quest for nonviolence, especially when the alternative is nonexistence.
Never before has the credibility of the United States been so undermined by a gross failure to honor our commitments.

50 years ago today, I learned the painful news that my friend, my mentor, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had been assassinated in Memphis, TN. He was my brother, my leader--that day it felt like something died in all of us. https://t.co/WkjkxJvXTC
Sometimes you have to get in trouble--good trouble, necessary trouble--to make a way out of no way.
53 years ago today, we were beaten, tear gassed, trampled by horses, and left bloody on the bridge in Selma. On this anniversary, we cannot rest. We must honor those who gave their lives for the right to vote. We must continue to find a way to get in the way. #goodtrouble https://t.co/pryA7cFSM8

58 years ago today, I was arrested for the first time as a participant in the sit-ins at lunch counters in downtown Nashville. Walking out to the paddy wagons, I tried to walk with a sense of pride &amp; dignity. I felt free, I felt liberated. I felt like I crossed over. #goodtrouble https://t.co/NSwsxarnva
Never has there been a more important time to guarantee that each voice can freely speak up and speak out. We cannot allow a few powerful companies to control what you see and do on the Internet. We must save #NetNeutrality to guarantee a free &amp; open internet for all #goodtrouble
.@SpeakerRyan Mr. Speaker, the time for action is now. We know the facts. There are too many guns. How many more children must die? How many more students? How many more teachers? People who are not willing to lead should get out of the way.
It is unbelievable, it is unreal that we consider a bill that turns the clock backwards and strikes a devastating blow in the fight for civil rights. https://t.co/3YMCscPero
We are shocked and numb. How many more must die? Our conscience must move us to action. It is time for the American people to demand action from their elected leaders.
This budget seeks to dismantle the social safety net. That is not right, it is not fair, and it is not just. Every person watching should understand that this budget is dangerous and unrealistic. https://t.co/oVqQJDzTES

If it hadn‚Äôt been for the march from Selma to Montgomery there would probably be no Barack Obama as President. I hope this conversation inspires young people to participate in the democratic process and understand that you too can make a contribution. We all have a role to play. https://t.co/BASjM7mMhi
It is painful to witness firsthand this attack on the remaining pillars of nonpartisan, governance, rules, and procedures, but it is unfathomable and unconscionable to attack our country‚Äôs national security personnel and apparatus for political cover and gain.
The frantic, desperate release of this memo leads us down a dangerous path of political spin and accusations instead of thoughtful, responsible, congressional oversight.
I never thought that I would witness the dismantling of the checks and balances of our country, and I never imagined that Republicans would cast aside the national security interests of our nation.
This is a dark hour and a sad day in the history of our nation.  Congress has a constitutional responsibility to protect the goodwill of the United States and to serve as an inspiration to the global community for whom the dream of democracy is a beacon of hope and light.
The movement lost another precious and devoted leader. Wyatt Tee Walker made a major contribution to the liberation and freeing of our nation. https://t.co/pmHdzDpqyX

As Dr. King used to say, you have to love the hell out of them. #goodtrouble
Today, Dr. King‚Äôs legacy is a guiding light. As we push and pull for a more just and more equal society, Dr King‚Äôs campaigns against war, against poverty, against racism show us that love is the universal value of a society at peace with itself. #goodtrouble

If Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was preaching today, he would be speaking the idea that we are one people, one family, one house‚Äîthe American house and the world house‚Äîthat we must learn to live together as brothers and sisters, if not we will perish as fools.
I am so proud that we were able to work in a bipartisan, bicameral manner to establish Georgia‚Äôs first National Historical Park in Dr. King‚Äôs name and legacy before what would be his 89th birthday and the 50th anniversary of his tragic assassination. https://t.co/dTRpRvoDYc
Congratulations to @FootballUGA on a hard-won victory. You never gave up, gave in, or gave out. You kept the faith and you kept your eyes on the prize.

I don‚Äôt understand why this Congress refuses to stand up to help young people and children. Failing to protect undocumented youth or reauthorize CHIP is cruel and inhumane. These young people are our future and they deserve better.
Yesterday taxpayers stood up and spoke out against Republicans lining the pocket of their donors by any means necessary. Did you hear their cries? Can you feel their pain? You did not, Mr. Speaker. You chose to turn a deaf ear and a blind eye. This bill is a shame and a disgrace.
I‚Äôve said on many occasions that you cannot get blood from a turnip, and you cannot justify robbing poor Peter to pay billionaire Paul. I urge all of my colleagues to be on the right side of history and to vote against this bill.
Working and middle class families, the sick, the elderly, and generations yet unborn will bear the burden of this reckless act.
I oppose this conference report with every bone in my body. This tax bill is a $2.3 trillion holiday gift for Wall Street, the rich, and the wealthy. Conceived in darkness and birthed with the help of donors and funders. This bill is not for the people. It is not tax reform.
Today is the last day of #OpenEnrollment so do your part. Take care of yourself. Take care of your family. Sign up and get covered today. https://t.co/WL93IeHGMm
I believe a free and open internet is part of the foundation of a modern democracy. It is plain wrong that the @FCC wants to end Title II Net Neutrality protection. It is yet another attack on those attempting to bring about the beloved community. #netneutrality
Congratulations Senator-elect Doug Jones! I look forward to working with you.
We've lost two reporters this week who will be remembered by history as giants in their field--one white, one black. Roy Reed &amp; Simeon Booker covered the civil rights movement and made a lasting contribution to our understanding of America's capacity for change.
Today is a day to get in #goodtrouble. Alabama, go out there and vote.
The vote is precious, almost sacred. Friends of mine paid the ultimate price so that every person can vote their conscience. As a native of Alabama, I ask you to do your part. Honor their sacrifice. Vote.
Take care of yourself. Take care of your family. Spread the word and help make sure everyone in your community signs up and gets covered by December 15th. #Souls2Enroll https://t.co/Xm4aWhl3Dv

I was beaten, left bloody and unconscious so that every American has the right to vote. Friends of mine gave their lives. Do your part. Vote
This spiteful, irresponsible tax cut is not worth the paper on which it is written.
Away from the cameras, Congressional Republicans will quietly begin to cut safety net programs to pay for their massive, corporate tax cut.
After this markup, after the winners pocket their rewards, the spotlight will move on. Every person in this room knows what will happen next
Most importantly, how can you bury your head in the sand when there are grave issues facing our country?
How can you attack immigrant children and DREAMers in a way that is just plain mean and heartless?
How can you target the sick, the elderly, and the disabled?
