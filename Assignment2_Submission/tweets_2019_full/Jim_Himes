The President asked a vulnerable foreign country to produce dirt on his opponent. So:

Quid pro quo not needed.

By the way, Mulvaney admitted there was a quid pro quo.

That‚Äôs funny because the President made no such distinction when he attacked the FBI. As usual, his apologists are left to explain what the President ‚Äúreally meant‚Äù.  I, for one, take him at his word. And the ‚ÄúObama leadership‚Äù of the FBI is a long line of Republicans. https://t.co/VGPgTxvE6t
The FBI is the finest law enforcement agency on the planet, filled with selfless patriotic men and women who sacrifice immensely for justice and their country. Something you will never ever understand. You don‚Äôt deserve to shine their shoes. https://t.co/ZSwkK60e5r

@JohnMetzger4 Congratulations. Not a single one of your statements is accurate.
It‚Äôs hard to come up with a policy that demeans our service men and women, adds to their stress, and is inconsistent with our values. But, of course, ‚Å¶@realDonaldTrump‚Å© can do it!!

@TMSuth Wow. I am impressed!
@LarryHome12 Oooh. Vicious burn. All the creative moxie of ‚ÄúI know you are, but what am I?‚Äù The classic ad hominem attack, but unvarnished with either humor or fact. Keep that blue-ribbon trolling up and you may double your follower count. To eight.
@JasonFromCT Yeah, not great trolling. Jarringly ad hominem. Really no humor. But big deductions for bad facts: I‚Äôm not near retirement age. And I made VP after 4 years like everyone else. (Did 3 years as an analyst and skipped B School). Trolling magic 8 ball says...C-  
Ouch
@NCRamsFan Now this is some reasonable trolling. Fact based, lightly, not over-bearingly ad hominem. The Mexican judge does deduct a point for humor paucity. But all in, a solid B+.
@CMKRidgefield I put some very serious hardware cloth into the ground and up to about 2 feet.
@holymoly1954 @jhsutherland2 @DevinCow Ok, so here we have a reading comprehension issue. You see, a right leaning guy like you can‚Äôt affirm that people are fleeing TO CT. The FOX talking points are that they flee FROM CT. That B/B- drops to a C.
@holymoly1954 Ok. So at least this metaphor makes sense. ‚ÄúTaking care of our field‚Äù is a reasonable if uninspired effort. Now, saying I‚Äôm not in CT when we‚Äôre out of session is a little weird, but I guess it sets up the troll. B or B- trolling, but I‚Äôd keep that day job.
@JayStorm_R_CT Oh Lordy. So lazy. You see, you don‚Äôt harvest crap. Or harvest anything you promote. So much possibility for good trolling with manure, rotten tomatoes, etc. and the best you can do is ‚Äúharvest crap‚Äù? Up your game troll.
