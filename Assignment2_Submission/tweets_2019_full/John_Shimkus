Leviticus 27:30 Thus all the title of the land, of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s; it is holy to the Lord.
The verse isn’t a response to the tragedy in Parkland, FL. My prayers are with those victims, their families, and all who have suffered because of the evil in this world.
The idea in Numbers 19 is that sin causes death, and the separation between God and humanity. The passage provides a way for the removal of sin, and foreshadows ultimate salvation from sin through Christ's passion and death.
I don't proselytize with additional commentary on the scripture, but given the responses to this verse I think some context is warranted.
As many know, I tweet a verse each day that comes from my daily Bible study. I've been doing it for many years. (https://t.co/zupxSCfjd4) This year I'm going through the Bible chronologically as is my weekly Bible class.
