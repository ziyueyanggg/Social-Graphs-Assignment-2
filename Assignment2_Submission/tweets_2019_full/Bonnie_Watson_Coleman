Meanwhile, poorer filers with fewer resources like accountants, lawyers, etc. are being targeted through the EITC, one of the most successful programs in lifting people out of poverty. 

"The pressure to focus on EITC has come from Republican members of Congress."
Cuts to IRS budget has caused a drop in audits among corporations and wealthy tax cheats and caused remaining auditors at the IRS to target poorer people. 

"Corps and the wealthy are the biggest beneficiaries of the IRS' decay."
