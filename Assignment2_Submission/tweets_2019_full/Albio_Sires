@JulioBorges @carlosvecchio @jguaido @RafaelDGuzmanR @JuanAndresMejia 4.5 millones de venezolanos se han visto obligados a abandonar sus hogares, muchos caminando largas distancias en condiciones muy peligrosas.

@JulioBorges @carlosvecchio @jguaido @RafaelDGuzmanR @JuanAndresMejia No podemos olvidar la crisis en Venezuela. Mientras los venezolanos luchan por sus vidas, el régimen de Maduro sigue robando los recursos del país.

@JulioBorges @carlosvecchio @jguaido @RafaelDGuzmanR @JuanAndresMejia 4.5 million Venezuelans have been forced to leave their homes, many walking hundreds of miles through very dangerous conditions. This is a humanitarian tragedy. We must redouble our efforts to advance a peaceful, civilian-led return to democracy in Venezuela.
@JulioBorges @carlosvecchio @jguaido @RafaelDGuzmanR @JuanAndresMejia We cannot lose sight of the crisis in Venezuela. While Venezuelans are struggling to survive, the Maduro regime continues to plunder the country’s resources with reckless abandon.
Today, I met with @JulioBorges and @carlosvecchio of the legitimate interim government of @jguaido, and @RafaelDGuzmanR and @JuanAndresMejia of Venezuela’s democratically elected National Assembly. https://t.co/kKNhhmzxKj

Today, I supported H.R.1497 to provide $16.7b for water infra projects and $14b to finance state clean water projects. This is money that Newark can use to upgrade its water infra. Also, every $1b invested in water infra yields 27k jobs. I am proud to support this bill.
@SpeakerPelosi Once that step has been completed, an inquiry of this level must be held in public because at its core, this inquiry is in the pursuit of truth and transparency.
I support the way the impeachment inquiry has been run &amp; @SpeakerPelosi decision to vote to make it public. In any inquiry, the initial stages should be done privately and securely so that all testimony is free of outside influence or attempts to align stories.
The death of ISIS leader al-Baghdadi is a great win for the fight against terrorism, but the fight is not over. Thank you to U.S. Special Forces, the intelligence community, and all other parties involved, including our Kurdish partners who provided critical information.

Additionally, we must protect the future generations of LBTQ+ Americans. I cosponsored H.R. 2775, the Protecting LGBTQ+ Youth Act to increase resources and update practices that allow child welfare professionals to save LGBTQ+ youth from abusive households.
I also cosponsored H.R. 3509, the LGBT Data inclusion Act, to make sure LGBTQ+ individuals are accurately recognized by our federal government.  This bill would add sexual identity and gender representation to all standard demographic information collection by federal agencies.
This bill would fortify the rights the LGBTQ+ community has fought for, specifically adding sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity protections to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
This year I was a proud to be an original cosponsor of the most comprehensive federal package of LGBTQ+ legislation to date, H.R. 5, the Equality Act.
October is #LGBTHistoryMonth, a time to celebrate and learn about the many achievements of the #LGBT community in U.S. history. The best way to honor the LBGTQ+ activists and advocates in our history is to protect the future of equal rights for all Americans.
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Read my op-ed in the Jersey Journal: https://t.co/t3L1AJAnIB
@realDonaldTrump The President should call on @senatemajldr to stop blocking legislation that would improve the lives of millions instead of having them sit in legislative purgatory. Every day of inaction by the Senate leads to one more avoidable gun death, missed payment, or missed prescription.
.@realDonaldTrump has repeatedly attacked Democrats in the House for not passing legislation. Since taking a majority, Democrats in the House have passed legislation to lower drug costs, close loopholes for firearm background checks, and provide disaster relief for Americans.
@SenRickScott Los @HouseDemocrats ya aprobaron un proyecto de ley, con apoyo de una gran parte del @HouseGOP, que otorga a los venezolanos #tps. @USCBO estimó que el proyecto de ley ayudaría a 200,000 venezolanos estadounidenses. @SenateGOP simplemente tiene que aprobar aquel proyecto de ley.
@SenRickScott Parece que las vidas de venezolanos americanos solo son parte de un juego político para @SenRickScott.
Me disgusta que @SenRickScott haya reintroducido su enmienda maliciosa para poner fin al estado de protección temporal para otros grupos y diluir la protecciones para los venezolanos.
@SenRickScott The @HouseDemocrats already passed a bill with significant @HouseGOP support granting Venezuelans #tps. @USCBO estimated that bill would help 200,000 Venezuelan Americans. @SenateGOP simply needs to pass that bill.
I am disgusted that @SenRickScott reintroduced his malicious amendment to effectively end temporary protected status for other groups and water-down protections for Venezuelans. @SenRickScott is playing politics with the lives of Venezuelan Americans.

On November 12th, #SCOTUS is hearing a challenge to #DACA by the Trump Administration. As I have said time and time again, immigrants are an essential aspect of U.S. culture and economy and our #Dreamers should be allowed to stay.
Wanton disregard for the value of diplomacy and interagency consultation leads to reckless policy decisions with lasting consequences for the future of U.S. national security and strategic interests.
The “ceasefire” in Syria is a last-ditch attempt to contain the aftermath of a short-sighted &amp; disastrous foreign policy decision by President Trump to green-light a Turkish incursion against our abandoned Kurdish allies. This is not how the United States conducts foreign policy.

@UN La comunidad internacional debe denunciar sus violaciones a los derechos humanos, en vez de darle legitimidad a su régimen.
Es incomprensible que los miembros de la @UN hayan votado a favor del régimen de Maduro para darle representación en el Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU. Sus fuerzas han cometido casi 7 mil ejecuciones extrajudiciales desde 2018, según las cifras manejadas por la ONU.
@UN The international community should be denouncing Maduro’s egregious violations of human rights, not elevating his murderous regime.

His inflammatory and distorted rhetoric demonstrates a total disregard for the citizens, institutions, elected officials, and democratic foundations of this country. The only thing inciting division is the President himself – which he is doing for his own political gain.
The President’s use of a legitimate legal process as a partisan tool to fearmonger and sow division in this country is completely unconscionable.
The impeachment process is a constitutional duty given to Congress by the founding fathers to conduct oversight and serve as a check on the other branches of government. It is a duty that is undertaken only with the utmost gravity and serious consideration.
L’shanah Tovah and happy new year to everyone in the 8th District and across the country celebrating Rosh Hashanah. Wishing everyone health and prosperity this year.

Yesterday, I chaired a @HouseForeign Western Hemisphere Subcommittee hearing on President Trump’s illogical cuts of over $400 million in assistance to Central America. I’m working hard to reverse this policy and restore our funding to address the root causes of migration. https://t.co/ntUPiVJMQ6
Yesterday, I joined @DWStweets in speaking at a @ftlchamber conference in Washington about the importance of deepening our engagement with allies in Latin America and the Caribbean. https://t.co/DW8M9OCmwo

On my way back from chairing a Western Hemisphere Subcommittee hearing, I ran into one of my constituents who is interning on Capitol Hill. Always great to see the people I am working for and to hear their opinions. https://t.co/YYOnaY2j2H
I have reviewed the transcript that the White House released. The President asked for a “favor” after U.S. aid to Ukraine (that the President halted) was brought up. That is quid pro quo. Congress must be allowed full access to the whistleblower complaint &amp; all related materials.
Yesterday, my staff met with students from @stevenscoop to answer their questions about Congress, the government, &amp; recent policy developments. As a former teacher, I find it so important to discuss the significance of engaging in our democratic institutions with young people. https://t.co/4KOa25nDvg
@HouseBudgetDems New Jersey has already committed $600 million to the Portal Bridge project. States cannot undertake these infrastructure burdens alone; the federal government must be willing to assist states in completing these projects.
@HouseBudgetDems I spoke about my commitment to provide funding for the Gateway Project, which includes the Hudson River Tunnels and the Portal North Bridge, along with other essential transportation networks for the 8th District.
Today, I attended an @HouseBudgetDems hearing on the need for federal investment in our infrastructure. https://t.co/K0yjIEf0Os
I support @SpeakerPelosi's decision to open a formal impeachment inquiry. Our government was created with checks and balances and the President must know that no one is above the law. https://t.co/PErBTG5OCN
After the President’s past obstructions and the events of the last 24 hours, I believe the House of Representatives must begin an impeachment inquiry.  Read my full statement here: https://t.co/LI80ViCXTQ https://t.co/la7JkEDvbE

Today, we honor and remember those POW &amp; MIA servicemembers who never returned home. Thank you to all those who have risked their lives in service to our country. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten.
@HouseForeign I also asked about the strength of the Taliban and the prospect of having any successful intra-Afghan dialogue.
Yesterday, at an @HouseForeign hearing on Administration policy in Afghanistan, I questioned Admin officials on the insensitive decision to invite Taliban leaders to Camp David so close to 9/11. https://t.co/mFP6pwzUrB
Yesterday, @HouseBudgetDems held a hearing discussing the impacts of financial inequality. I asked if lowering Union memberships had an impact on increasing financial inequality. We are working to #RaiseTheWage and put an end to generational inequality. https://t.co/F9dGFhtWtx

The NJ delegation met yesterday with @SecretaryWay to discuss the 2020 Census in New Jersey. The Census is an integral part of our democracy and it is crucial that everyone participate. I am committed to making sure every member of the 8th district is counted. https://t.co/cBB9ieTKKZ
He was an educator, someone who should be bettering the minds of his students to create a more tolerant society.  Instead, he partook in a racist practice that has been used to mock and denigrate for more than a century.
I find it disgusting that the PM of Canada, Justin Trudeau has dressed up in blackface and brownface numerous times.  That he was a teacher in at least one of these instances is even more disgusting.
Today is National HIV/AIDS and Aging Awareness Day. In 2016, almost half of all people diagnosed with HIV were 50 or older. In 2017, 1 in 6 new diagnoses were of someone 50 or older. Learn more about how aging can impact HIV and your health: https://t.co/LKAvdRSWgS
This PSA shows the deadly realities for students going back to school. I voted in favor of #HR8 &amp; yet again call on @senatemajldr to bring this legislation for a vote. Every day we wait we are losing lives. Enough is enough, school should be a place of learning not gun violence. https://t.co/mTHEEVamzL
#OnThisDay in 1793, George Washington laid the foundational stone for the United States Capitol Building. The occasion was marked by a large ceremony, where Washington laid the first cornerstone on a custom-made silver plate. https://t.co/0XIaVHNTKH
Becoming a US #Citizen is one of the proudest moments of my life. The US has always welcomed those in need, like my family. For generations, immigrants have enriched our communities, economy, and culture &amp; #Citizenship grants immigrants a greater say in our nation’s future. https://t.co/hotnmDtd05
.@realDonaldTrump’s new #PublicCharge rule is a clear attempt to taint our immigration system with discrimination. The President’s rule would disproportionately impact people of color. I am fighting with #TriCaucus to #ProtectFamilies and say #NoToPublicCharge.
The Department of Transportation awarded multiple federal safety grants to NJ institutions. The grants will help to ensure that NJ continues to properly transport and dispose of any hazardous materials, keeping residents and our infrastructure safe. https://t.co/phYSzDXYHo
Ortega sigue encarcelando a más de 100 presos políticos en #Nicaragua y le negó la entrada de una comisión de @OAS_official. Debemos enviar un mensaje claro a Ortega: o permites la visita del equipo a #Nicaragua o enfrentarás más sanciones. https://t.co/p34YtwjTbn
Ortega is still holding over 100 political prisoners and has now prevented an @OAS_official mission from investigating the crisis in #Nicaragua. Our message to Ortega is clear: let the OAS do its work or face further sanctions. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/p34YtwjTbn
I am honored to serve alongside my colleagues in the largest Congressional Hispanic Caucus in U.S. History. Representing the proud Hispanic communities in New Jersey’s 8th District is a privilege. Happy #HispanicHeritageMonth https://t.co/Pbc0jJkLSR
Today, the House voted on bills to ban oil/gas drilling on our coasts, on the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I voted for each bill – protecting our waterways &amp; lands is more important than companies making money. https://t.co/0PNFCnjaRJ
I am disappointed in the @USSupremeCourt's decision to allow the @WhiteHouse's asylum ban to be fully enforced. It is contrary to American values to deny the right to request asylum to those fleeing the most desperate of circumstances. My full statement: https://t.co/GEkAhVKgWp
It is essential that we protect the independence and integrity of our scientific agencies to ensure that policy and decisions with real-life implications are based on complete, factual, and evidence-based information.
Reports that Acting WH Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross threatened NOAA officials in order to corroborate the President’s inaccurate claims regarding the path of Hurricane Dorian are extremely troubling.
On #September11th 2001, the worst terrorist attack in our nation’s history was carried out. Today, we reflect on those who lost their lives and those who courageously rushed to the scene, without hesitation, to help the survivors. #NeverForget.
Last night, I joined @RepEspaillat to celebrate the launch of the Congressional Friends of the Dominican Republic Caucus. I look forward to continuing to strengthen relations between the U.S. and the #DR. https://t.co/oupPLxhePe

Now that Congress is back from August recess, it is beyond time for @SenateMajLdr McConnell to bring forward commonsense gun reforms like #HR8 that will save American lives. We can no longer stand by while innocent people continue to die in mass shootings.
H.R. 1420 encourages the adoption of energy-efficient information technologies across all federal agencies. These bills are important steps in the right direction to keeping our air clean and our planet healthy
H.R. 1768 would reauthorize the DERA program which gives financial assistance to people or organizations that want to replace old dirty diesel engines (in trucks or school buses or tractors) with new clean ones. These are concrete steps we can take to keep our air clean.
Tonight, the House will be voting on two bills – H.R. 1768, the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) of 2019, and H.R. 1420, the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act.

This past Friday, I joined @GovMurphy &amp; @MayorBollwage in front of the Elizabeth Town Hall to honor the @ElmoraYouth Troopers. Their recent trip to the Little League World Series as Mid-Atlantic Champs has made the Elizabeth, the 8th District, and New Jersey proud! https://t.co/aVGUcVdIdW
@realDonaldTrump The decision to repurpose funding for military projects towards a Border Wall is irresponsible, pointless, and offensive to the brave men and women that keep America safe. Read my full statement: https://t.co/npYd1s8CC7
.@realDonaldTrump has shown time and time again that his true interests are not in protecting the American people, but his own political gain.
@realDonaldTrump As my Democratic colleagues and I continue to fight to #ProtectTheDream in Congress all DACA recipients should keep their status up to date: https://t.co/PC5KpBq9lm
