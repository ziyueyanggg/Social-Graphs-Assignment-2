Colorado‚Äôs 3rd District however is the district where most of his bill would have an impact, and I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt speak out on behalf of some of my constituents who have yet to have their voices heard or their issues addressed in this process.
I applaud the CORE Act‚Äôs sponsor, and my Colorado colleague Joe Neguse, for his passion to protect public lands in Colorado. We share that passion.
I am optimistic that we can find a balanced public lands bill that reflects all these communities, but it can‚Äôt happen if one side is left out of the conversation from the beginning. More outreach needs to happen, negotiations need to take place, and compromises need to be made.
There is no doubt that the CORE Act has the support of many Coloradans in communities around the state. It is just as important to listen to the supporters of this bill as it is to listen to the input of Western Coloradans who are also affected by this bill.

America needs a robust All-of-the-above energy strategy to meet the needs of our families, not a ‚Äòneutral stance.‚Äô Jordan Cove has had support from both sides of the isle in the past, and its importance to Colorado and the rest of the world cannot be overstated.
It is creates a market for Russians and other adversaries to export to countries with no intentions to reduce pollution.
It fails to replace the AVERAGE $91,000 salary jobs that tens of thousands of Coloradan families rely on.
It ignores the fact that done responsibly, LNG actually reduces the carbon emissions and pollution outputted from older traditional fuel burning power sources.
It cuts off funding for schools, roads, and other necessary local community resources.
For starters, it‚Äôs a disservice to the Western Slope residents who understand the potential the Piceance Basin, our country‚Äôs 2nd largest natural gas reserve, could have on the economy.
