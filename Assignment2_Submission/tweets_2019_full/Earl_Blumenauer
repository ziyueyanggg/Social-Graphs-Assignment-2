Courage
Done right, we can continue our ambition for reform in this Congress, doing our work #ForThePeople, while laying the foundation for the highest form of executive accountability, #TrumpImpeachment.
The public should see how we assemble the agenda; how comprehensive the case becomes and what role everyone in the caucus can play to complete this process.
There is the opportunity to launch separate hearing and fact-finding efforts for the various highly questionable actions by not just Trump, but his enablers throughout the government, his businesses and the campaign, to say nothing of special interests and foreign actors.
We have key committees with strong leadership and members who have been preparing for this moment for months. 

We have started building the record for action.

We have the ability to create other mechanisms—panels, task forces, select and joint committees.
I fully understand the potential pitfalls and challenges, but that is not a reason to neglect our responsibility to hold him accountable. 

It is a reason to be careful and strategic, and that should start now.
There is a reason he is virtually daring us to act. He thrives on chaos &amp; desperately wants to change the subject away from his many failures &amp; the range of issues that people deeply care about, which Democrats have been hard at work on delivering results #ForThePeople.
I fully understand that it must be handled carefully and strategically so that Trump cannot capitalize on it.
I was one of the very first to call for an #ImpeachmentInquiry.

It made sense months ago and is more compelling today as Trump’s behavior grows ever more outrageous and dangerous, while support within our caucus continues to grow.
Yesterday was a turning point. Here are my thoughts. (Thread)

It is exciting and long overdue that the House of Representatives start acting on impeachment.

Today, @AOC, @SenSanders, and I unveiled our resolution to declare a #ClimateEmergency. This is about telling the truth about the climate crisis and the urgent, massive action needed to address it.

A great event with “All Hands on Deck” solving critical environmental problems through science and policy with Dr. Bill Ripple. Great crowd, energy, and commitment to winning this climate fight.

Huge CONGRATS to the #USWNT for their incredible win today at the @FIFAWWC final and a special shout out to all of the @ThornsFC members who played in this tournament! Looking forward to seeing you in the US House @AOC #BAONPDX #onenationoneteam https://t.co/oxJU6tRQws
On this #IndependenceDay let’s reflect on the founding principles of this great nation &amp; continue to fight until they are afforded to ALL.

These principles inspired people around the world to strive for their freedom. May they continue to inspire us in this fight, here at home. https://t.co/uDYXePdLM8

June is Alzheimer’s and Brain Awareness Month. I’m proud to fight for the Improving #HOPE4AlzAct to give clinicians the knowledge and tools to better help families with dementia. More research and awareness is key to ending this disease. #ENDALZ https://t.co/3PxXkNXDXP
To import animal trophies, you need a permit from U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife, so I co-wrote an amendment to the funding bill that gives these permits a budget of $0, which prevents these trophies from being permitted. 

An innovative way to #resist this cruel policy. #BanTrophyHunting https://t.co/PMlpozCoN3
The SAFE Act, which passed the House today, is common sense election reform. It included my provision to mandate paper ballots—the Oregon way. This is essential for free, fair and secure elections. It’s now on the Senate...
Sadly, this is exactly what happened today. https://t.co/lcZIJz236P
Congress has a duty to provide basic necessities to those coming to the US, but in doing so we can't sacrifice our values. The House just capitulated to Mitch McConnell &amp; passed the Senate's bill to provide millions to ICE &amp; CBP. 

I voted NO. This is not who we are. #AbolishICE
Another cannabis win in the House! 

Today, we passed new banking protections for cannabis businesses. We must address the irrational, unfair, &amp; unsafe denial of their banking services around the country. Let's keep up this momentum. Time for the Senate to act!
Horrific. https://t.co/V9gQUez2hH
The House passed an amendment I introduced with @CongressmanRaja to fight the Trump administration's culture of corruption. The Dept. of Transportation has no business using a public office for private gain, especially when it benefits your family.

The wealthiest country in the world should not have people struggling to finance their health and education. Those are two of our most important human rights, not a privilege for the few. 

We must #CancelStudentDebt now, especially for low income students across the country.
Unfortunately, I was flying back to DC during a fantastic showing by #USWMNT today and missed an especially big performance by former @UPortland star @mPinoe. 

I'm excited to watch them keep it going on Friday. On to the quarterfinals!

Both passed in voice votes, but a roll call vote will be taken on the first measure, likely on Thursday.

ALERT 🚨: Major victory! 

Today, the first ever amendment to protect tribal cannabis programs passed the House without opposition. While I continue to work with @RepDebHaaland on our larger movement to legalize, we must protect tribal sovereignty.
In our America, justice &amp; equality are celebrated. 

Today, as we recognize #Juneteenth, we are reminded of all the work that remains undone, and commit to reflect and repair America's brutal history of slavery for a brighter future.
A big week ahead for cannabis reform. With every committee hearing and amendment introduced, we are one step closer to ending the senseless prohibition of cannabis and the failed war on drugs.
We are one step closer to passing #DriversLicenses4All #HB2015. Earlier today it passed the OR House and it will now be heading to the Senate.

Thanks to @diego4oregon, @alonsonhli_leon, @CausaOregon and so many others for your persistence and dedication. https://t.co/CKSdCpRDSs
This is wrong. The effects of slavery have carried on far past June 19, 1865 &amp; electing an African-American president did not do away the harms done to generations. 

I applaud @HouseJudiciary for holding a #Juneteenth hearing on establishing a commission to study reparations. https://t.co/Ya8b6KSV77

Today's turnout in support of #MedicareForAll was inspiring. The American people believe that health care is a right, not a privilege. It's past time our system reflect that.

The internet doesn’t belong to @RealDonaldTrump or massive broadband providers, it belongs to the people. If you agree, raise your voice and demand a vote in the Senate on the #SaveTheInternet Act and join me and millions of Americans as we fight to save #NetNeutrality.

The values that are at stake are about more than politics - they are about our country!

The American people deserve to witness this investigation through public hearings. I hope the public will remain engaged, involved, and informed during this process.
13/
If we can get H.Res.257 passed, the Judiciary Committee will have the full support of the House to begin this work.
12/
There are few dozen more Members of Congress who have said they support opening an impeachment inquiry, but they have not signed on to this #legislation.
11/
I was one of the first to co-sponsor...there are still only 11 of us.
10/
Congresswoman @RepRashida dug in and drafted a House Resolution to launch an #ImpeachmentInquiry (#H.Res.257).
9/
The Judiciary Committee can start an impeachment inquiry OR the House of Representatives can vote to start an inquiry.
8/
My team and I researched and spoke with experts and confirmed that an official #ImpeachmentInquiry is given more latitude by the courts to compel witnesses and testimony.
7/
House committees are doing oversight, but we have never seen as much obstruction to those efforts as we have with Trump. P.S. #Obstruction is an #ImpeachableOffense.
6/
I disagree that a President is somehow #AboveTheLaw and can’t be charged while in office. But #Congress2019 has the power to do something about it.
5/
Serious allegations were laid out but #SpecialCounselMueller was unable to pursue criminal charges against the President.
4/
I did so because after reviewing the #MuellerReport it was clear that this was the appropriate next step.
3/
Last month, I became the 7th Member of Congress to co-sponsor @RashidaTlaib’s legislation to open an impeachment inquiry.

Let’s talk about impeachment.

A reminder on #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay that Americans suffer more gun violence than people in any other developed country. This is a public health crisis that @HouseDemocrats are finally addressing.
