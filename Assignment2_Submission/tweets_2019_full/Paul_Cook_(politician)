I commend our brave US military forces for the successful raid in northwest Syria on Saturday which killed the world’s most wanted terrorist, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. We must continue to be vigilant in our efforts to fight terrorism and defend our national security.
Rep. Cook Statement on Impeachment: https://t.co/HGMza5FYMK
For two decades, Kurds have fought on frontlines alongside US troops against terror. We should remain in a position to prevent unnecessary conflict between two of our traditional allies. Abandoning the Kurds could lead to devastating loss of life and the potential return of ISIS.

@CBluy Cheryl, I agree; Steve Knight is a good man and a great friend of mine. My statement was referring to Steve King, a Congressman from Iowa with a long history of racist statements and behavior, not Steve Knight.
Whether deriding racial minorities at home or cavorting with Nazis and white supremacists abroad, Rep. Steve King brings dishonor to himself, the party of Abraham Lincoln, and his nation. We must reconsider whether Mr. King has the moral authority to continue serving in Congress. https://t.co/pUNn6XOpbE
America has lost a true statesman. President Bush spent his entire life in service to our nation. He was a naval aviator, a Congressman, Ambassador, CIA Chief, Vice President, and President. We will never forget his steadfast leadership and unwavering commitment to our nation.
