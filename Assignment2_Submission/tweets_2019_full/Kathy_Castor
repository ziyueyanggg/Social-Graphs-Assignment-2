Open enrollment for affordable insurance in the https://t.co/zZt0hjYBfd marketplace begins Nov. 1. But be careful: the Trump administration has allowed the proliferation of junk insurance health plans that leave consumers on the hook for massive medical bills.
Junk plans often do not cover preexisting health conditions like heart disease or diabetes, mental health coverage, prescription drug costs or ER trips. I grilled a Trump official during my hearing on the sabotage of health insurance that has led to higher costs for families. https://t.co/rTs8NkstKk
The Senate also could take up the Violence Against Women Act that passed the House months ago and contains the rape kit provisions. Justice delayed is justice denied‚Ä¶ and #VAWA is another bill stalled by a Senate that refuses to do the vital work for American families.
Untested rape kits are barriers to justice, so I was heartened to vote to reauthorize the #DebbieSmithAct to ensure that victims &amp; law enforcement can get the criminal evidence they need. All who believe in justice must urge Sen. McConnell to allow a vote on the bill right away.
