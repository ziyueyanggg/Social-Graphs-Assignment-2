I support resolution to censure Rep. Adam Schiff because I believe that he should stop holding secret hearings in the basement of the Capitol and instead give the American people the transparency they deserve. He must be held accountable for refusing access to the public.
I was sad to learn this morning of the passing of Oversight Committee Chair Elijah Cummings.  I appreciated of him that his service was driven by a deep personal faith and desire to see the best in our nation ‚Äî and in the kind and respectful way he treated others.
Impeachment proceedings should be deliberate, defined, and transparent. The "impeachment" proceedings happening in Washington right now are being conducted in a top-secret room in the basement of the Capitol.

#CongressIsBroken
Turns out it costs $396 billion https://t.co/A5sZWARhue
Party leaders sent us an 1169-page bill this morning. Vote is this evening.

As of 1pm, congressional offices were calling each other to see if anyone even knew the total cost

I cosponsored a 1-week extension to fund the gov't while we #ReadTheBill &amp; negotiate a real compromise
SURVEY: The support shown for the ‚ÄúGreen New Deal‚Äù ‚Äì including from several presidential candidates - is alarming. It would be nothing short of an unprecedented socialist reorganization of our society.

During #SOTU, I appreciated the discussion of how we came together during WWII - there‚Äôs more that unites than divides us. Congress must put aside party politics, recognize that ending the humanitarian crisis on our border should not be a partisan issue

While some things have changed in Congress, my commitment to serving the people of our district &amp; defending our Texas values remains the same

Please take this survey &amp; let me know your opinion on several important issues expected to come before Congress:

Was on House Floor to discuss humanitarian crisis at border. Cartels abuse U.S. generosity &amp; profit from trafficking drugs/humans. Border wall would push back on these crimes, ensuring migrants cross at port of entry protected by law enforcement

Watch: https://t.co/lmxOgir0Xn
SURVEY: Last night, the House (with my support) passed a spending bill that included funding for a border wall. As we wait on the Senate to pass or reject the bill, please share your thoughts with me on the construction of a border wall: https://t.co/WVBiyDMtRD https://t.co/yz8qDWmhBr
To fix the FEMA process, we need change at the federal level. In the meantime, families and communities need help navigating this complex system.

Check out this guest column in @Vicadvocate for my take on this complicated issue.

Great to see that Pastor Andrew Brunson has been released. Pastor Brunson ran the Resurrection Church in Izmir, Turkey, until he was wrongfully imprisoned and held under house arrest in 2016. It's wonderful to see him go free today.
I applaud @POTUS for his efforts to combat human trafficking. This modern slavery affects adults and children of all backgrounds and must come to an end. https://t.co/z0t6zxyQWg
