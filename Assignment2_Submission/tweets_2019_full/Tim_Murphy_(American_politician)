Former Senator Kay Hagan was a dedicated steward to all North Carolinians. My thoughts and prayers are with her family and loved ones as we all mourn her passing and celebrate the many accomplishments she made throughout her life.
The service I attended today was a great memorial to a dedicated public servant. My prayers are with his family today as he rightly receives the great honor of lying in state.
Rep. Elijah Cummings‚Äô service to our country transcended politics. It was with great sadness that I heard of his passing.

W‚Ä¶RT @üö® BREAKING: I just filed a rules change to allow ALL Members of Congress access to proceedings related to impeachment.

Will Democrats allow transparency? Or do they have something to hide?

Time‚Äôs up. Schiff‚Äôs shady impeachment scheme can‚Äôt continue. https://t.co/jLoBaf0rPM
House Democrats, without regard to facts, have taken a guilty until proven innocent approach to impeachment. I'm disgusted by the unfair and unprecedented process through which they have conducted their Soviet-style investigation. Americans deserve transparency.
