I am in the Rules Committee room where Democrats are marking up their impeachment resolution.

@RepDLesko offered an amendment requiring any evidence which is exculpatory regarding the President to be given to the Judiciary Committee.

Democrats rejected it.
The Democrat impeachment resolution is an attempt to ratify their ongoing faulty process. 

It is not a serious document, and it will not provide the transparency and fairness required of an impeachment inquiry. https://t.co/xzOBcHNrUB
Having read the resolution, it's clear: you can have due process if the Democrat chair or majority agrees to it.
Here is the resolution being rushed by Democrats to the floor without any Republican input to ratify their “impeachment inquiry.” They are not capable of running a fair, transparent, and impartial process. https://t.co/UiPnHCXoBw

The first responders who ran into burning buildings, the Flight 93 passengers who took back the plane aimed at the Capitol, all who risked and, in many cases, gave their lives to save others on 9/11, will be remembered as long as our country endures.
Like most Americans, I could not fathom the hatred and cruelty that would lead anybody to kill almost 3,000 innocent people in such a horrifying manner. But just as we will not forget the evil of that day, we will always remember the heroism.
Americans will never forget the evil committed by terrorists in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001. I still remember the disbelief I felt when watching the attacks.

Also, don’t forget to check in on your family, friends, and neighbors who may need some extra help. Does anyone you know have a medical device that depends on electricity? Have a backup plan in the event of a power loss and other contingencies.
Our part of Virginia will likely face heavy rain and winds from Hurricane Florence. Be prepared. Pay attention to the forecast and emergency updates, and make sure you have enough food, water, medication, batteries, and other supplies to last for a few days if necessary.
