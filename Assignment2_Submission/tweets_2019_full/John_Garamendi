As a rancher and a farmer, I understand the importance of a robust agricultural labor sector and I am proud to support this critically important legislation.
Today I joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers in cosponsoring the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, which will modernize our guestworker program, establish a path to citizenship for certified agricultural workers, and strengthen our agricultural sector.

When I asked Mr. Muilenburg to address this, his response was incomplete and insufficient.
@TransportDems @Boeing Boeing’s track record of putting profits before safety is unconscionable and it is clear to me that they have a systemic problem in their company. Not only are there problems with the 737 MAX, there are problems with their KC-46A.

We need to reinvigorate the United States industrial base to produce generic medicines and antibiotics domestically. Doing so will create thousands of new middle-class jobs and make our country safer.
The Chinese government is the principal developer of generic prescriptions, which account for approximately 90 percent of pharmaceuticals. China’s chokehold on the global pharmaceutical market leaves our servicemembers and our nation vulnerable to attack.
Right now, China has the ability to attack the United States without firing a single shot by poisoning our servicemembers’ medicines or cutting off their supply.

The President is abusing his power to usurp the power of Congress. This is unconstitutional and unacceptable, and I’m glad that this resolution has passed Congress.
To usurp the authority of Congress and the power of the purse is unconstitutional and unacceptable. Total power should never reside solely with the President, but this is exactly what he has used this emergency declaration to accomplish.
Prior to the vote, I debated this issue on the House floor. The issue is not whether the President has the authority to declare a national emergency, it is about the way this authority is being used.
Republicans and Democrats agreed that this emergency declaration was unwarranted and set a dangerous precedent that would allow President’s to behave like kings who could rob the Treasury.
Congress just passed a  bipartisan resolution to terminate President Trump’s emergency declaration that allowed him to raid crucial military funds to pay for his border wall. https://t.co/U0nQza8hMm

This violates that constitutional oath of office that all federal employees, members of Congress, and president takes. This is simply unacceptable.
It is no secret that President Trump is taking money from countless foreign governments and enriching his and his family’s private businesses at the government and taxpayers expense. https://t.co/Y8GgPN6Wq5

Carry on our sweet survivors…carry on!

- Patti and John Garamendi, Ethiopia 1966-68
We can only imagine the hours of additional footage that are saved forever. This moment in history needs the Peace Corps more than ever.

“A Peace Corps volunteer learns peace, lives peace, and labors for peace from the beginning of their service until the end of their life.”
The Ambassador of Kazakhstan recently shared this with us when she hosted an international delegation. 

The entire crowd was thrilled and the ovation was heartfelt. They have given the Peace Corps a gift that will last forever.
As we have returned to the 1993 independent states on diplomatic trips, it is a joy to talk to leaders that first met Peace Corps volunteers when the Berlin Wall came down. Our U.S. Archives has the first agreements with America that were the joint Peace Corps documents.
We felt like it was all a soundtrack of our lives as we have continued our work for peace, food security, working in famine camps, agriculture, environment, health, and education around the world.
THREAD: The premier of the Peace Corps’ new documentary, A Towering Task, was moving and magnificent. The music, the village scenes, and the narrative delivered by so many people that I love literally brought tears our eyes and we were often choked up.
