This White House memo is merely a summary of President Trump‚Äôs conversation with the president of Ukraine, it's not a transcript. What we read underscores why Congress needs to see the full whistleblower report. 

Trump's behavior is un-American and a danger to our democracy.
The memo points to several instances that demand a closer look:

üö© P. 3: ‚ÄúI would like you to do us a favor though‚Ä¶‚Äù
üö© P. 3: ‚ÄúWhatever you can do, it‚Äôs very important that you do it if that‚Äôs possible.‚Äù
üö© P. 4: "so if you can look into it‚Ä¶‚Äù

This isn't normal or acceptable. https://t.co/umF3h6Tv5H
The memo released by the White House is damning. And the fact that Trump thinks that this doesn't point to any wrongdoing speaks volumes about what his administration finds to be ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù behavior. #CultureOfCorruption
President Trump has chosen to put corporate interests over working people.

Well, WE choose:
‚úÖGood benefits
‚úÖ‚úÖBetter wages
‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ Unions

Proud to stand with all union workers demanding better. Right now, we're marking up the #PROAct to protect workers' rights to unionize. https://t.co/Bts2dhvRT7
Congress must pass the Restoring Overtime Pay Act to strengthen protections for more workers and ensure that the American people can see their efforts reflected in their paychecks. 

I will keep fighting to restore the value of work and give families the opportunity to get ahead.
It's immoral for a worker to be on the job for 60 to 70 hours a week without being paid for the extra hours they worked.

Overtime standards are long overdue for a meaningful update that will protect more workers and put money back in the pockets of millions of families.
ICYMI: Today, millions of workers were left behind by the Trump Administration. The new overtime rule falls dramatically short of what the American people need and deserve. #FixOvertime https://t.co/iTZ8w2bNjj

You have failed to uphold the Constitution and focus on your job as president. Instead, you continue to profit from the presidency, violate democratic norms, and demonstrate an unprecedented level of contempt for the rule of law. On #ConstitutionDay, I urge you to read it.

#ConstitutionDay serves as a reminder that no one is above the law.

This bill ensures that defendants can access source code to challenge evidence used against them. It also sets standards and testing to assess whether forensic algorithms are fair enough to be used. https://t.co/nkkDCi577Y
People are being convicted based on evidence analyzed by potentially flawed forensic algorithms. But they can't challenge this evidence due to the intellectual property rights of software developers. This is unjust and directly undermines a defendant‚Äôs due process rights.
