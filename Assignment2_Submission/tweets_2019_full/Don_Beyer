US even asked Kurds to REMOVE defenses BEFORE the Turkish offensive. Kurds complied and now being displaced. WH says not our problem.
Trump just called the passage of the United States Constitution that the Founders inserted to stop corruption and prevent the President from profiting from their office "this phony Emoluments Clause." https://t.co/Ujk19EPyE9

A devastating statistic: "Nearly 1 million women alive today have reported being shot or shot at by intimate partners, and 4.5 million women have reported being threatened with a gun."

The connection between gun violence and domestic violence gets clearer with every study. https://t.co/IXeVhprGbv
A top member of a “homicidal Neo-Nazi guerrilla organization” linked to murders and bomb plots posed at a “Hate Camp” with an AK-47 and high capacity drum magazine.
