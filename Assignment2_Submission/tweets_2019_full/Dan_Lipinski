Today, @BishopBarron, native of Western Springs, offered the opening prayer in the House. He repeated the message he delivered to members of Congress yesterday, reminding us that we are ‚Äúcalled to serve justice‚Äù so we must put aside our own pursuit of wealth, pleasure &amp; power. https://t.co/hRXcpB6cgT
"I‚Äôm not sure what accountability means if accountability means, Mr. Muilenburg, that you received a $15 million bonus after these planes crashed. I‚Äôm not sure who‚Äôs been held accountable for this." #boeing #737MAX @TransportDems https://t.co/nq3iOxmJiV
After two deadly accidents involving the #Boeing #737MAX, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee launched an investigation into what happened. Today we will hear from Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing‚Äôs CEO. The hearing starts now: https://t.co/ffEbvroOmF
We must hold #Turkey accountable for its horrific crimes against the Kurds. That‚Äôs why the House passed the #PACTAct, which imposes strong economic sanctions and stops weapons sales to Turkey that could be used in Syria.
I support the House resolution affirming U.S. recognition of the #ArmenianGenocide. This resolution encourages public understanding of the facts of the early 20th century ethnic cleansing campaign &amp; rejects efforts to associate the US gov't w/ denial of the those horrific events
.@TransportDems committee has a responsibility to get to the bottom of what went wrong in the #Boeing #737Max certification process in order to make changes so the public is assured that the Lion Air &amp; Ethiopian Airlines tragedies never happen again. We must fulfill this duty. https://t.co/0A3GXxF3gF

.@potus lifting sanctions against Turkey doubles down on a dangerous policy that enabled the Turkish incursion in Syria. This decision increased Russian influence in the region &amp; risks resurgence of ISIS. Congress needs to pass veto-proof legislation to impose sanctions on Turkey

It was an absolute pleasure to visit w/ #IL03 veterans on #HonorFlight today. I met Tom Chambers, Commander of the Orland Park @AmericanLegion &amp; other Orland vets who made the trip. We‚Äôre grateful for the sacrifices they made to protect our nation @Honor_Flight_CH https://t.co/qZSBymySyG

#ClimateChange threatens our drinking water. That's why we can't afford EPA's dangerous dirty water agenda. We need to #ProtectCleanWater, not gut basic protections for our water and health. #ProtectCleanWater https://t.co/DJHkBE14qG
I‚Äôm happy to celebrate International Day of Democracy &amp; #ConstitutionDay this week. 232 years ago, our constitution was ratified, creating our government &amp; system of checks &amp; balances &amp; separation of powers. I‚Äôm proud to work #ForthePeople in Congress. #IL03 https://t.co/IttrGtEESk
I celebrated #ConstitutionDay a day early today by speaking at @LewisUniversity about Congress. My favorite parts were showing Schoolhouse Rock Bill to the students (a staple of mine when teaching American Government), meeting students, and seeing one of my summer interns, Tyler. https://t.co/RKROh4pc4I
Hispanic Americans have contributed immeasurably to our country and my own community - as doctors, teachers, first responders, scientists, organizers, and entrepreneurs. Thank you for your hard work, and have a wonderful #HispanicHeritageMonth! https://t.co/mPcijDDcJx
Beautiful morning at Brookfield Farmers Market! Spoke with Cycle Brookfield about helping with 31st Street Corridor Project. I‚Äôm always happy to support bike/ped projects which promote health, community, &amp; a cleaner environment. @VisitBrookfield https://t.co/SpmjOQjAk1
I will continue my efforts at the federal level to get the @epa to develop a strong federal ethylene oxide standard to protect the health and safety of those who live near facilities that use this dangerous chemical. 3/3
and the @ilenviro for building coalitions and bringing a resolution to keep our communities safe. This is a promising development for those, including me, who live in communities near the Sterigenics facility in Willowbrook. 2/3
I‚Äôm encouraged by today‚Äôs news that state lawmakers have come to a bipartisan agreement on legislation to phase out ethylene oxide emissions for sterilization facilities and hospitals. I thank these officials as well as advocacy groups including @StopSterigenics 1/3
It was an honor to join Aviation Machinist First Class Bernard B. Bartusiak at the Pentagon for his WWII Distinguished Flying Crosses &amp; an Air Medal awards from @secnav76 of @USNavy. Mr. Bartusiak, who resides in Palos Hills, is an inspiration to all. #IL03 https://t.co/cXqqgs89g7
Happy #FlashbackFriday to the @SaintXavier Cougar 5K run back in 2014. I‚Äôm looking forward to 5K season starting again and some crisp, fall running weather. Have a great weekend in #IL03! #FBF üçÇüçÅ https://t.co/zOgHg0HzmI
For 25 years VAWA has been key to preventing &amp; helping victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. We‚Äôre all counting on the Senate to take up the House-passed VAWA HR1585. Stand up for #VAWA4ALL! #VAWA25 https://t.co/MXHfVXZ8Y1
The #CleanWaterRule repeal is another move by @epa to put the health of the public, the environment &amp; our economy at risk. Water quality upstream directly impacts the water we all rely on. I‚Äôll continue to fight for policies to strengthen, not weaken clean water protections. üí¶ https://t.co/XLSnea4FUs
Pleased to announce that the Palos Heights &amp; North Palos Fire Dept.‚Äôs received $220k from @fema &amp; @DHSgov through the AFG program to help fund SCBA‚Äôs &amp; other equipment to keep them safe while protecting #IL03. https://t.co/GKH3W3Bp2N

Very happy for Corina. It‚Äôs hard to believe I worked on this case w/ her for 13 years. She shouldn't have been targeted, especially when the government made a mistake w/ the citizenship application of her late husband. I'm happy for her it's finally over. https://t.co/f3HGOY4DDz
I‚Äôm alarmed by the fed deficit exceeding $11t in 1st 11 months of FY19. I support @HouseBlueDogs‚Äô measures ensuring we responsibly spend fed dollars, like the #BalancedBudgetAmendment.
Glad to see the Merrionette Park Fire Dept. received $121,000 from @fema and @DHSgov through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program. This funding will help finance replacements for equipment to help keep #IL03 firefighters safe &amp; healthy on the job. https://t.co/dAurkO8rvk
Pleased my colleagues on @housescience Energy Subcommittee adopted my Clean Industrial Technology Act amendment encouraging sustainable chemistry while working to reduce industrial emissions. We need #climatechange solutions that meet demand for environmentally conscious products
18 yrs ago, 3,000 Americans lost their lives in one of the darkest moments in our history. But shining through that darkness was the heroism of 1st responders whose selflessness saved lives, &amp; the resiliency of the American people who responded w/ strength &amp; unity #NeverForget911 https://t.co/hYO4NO4LUE
We must continue to work on improving the ACA, not abandon it. I am committed to ensuring that Americans have access to affordable, quality care. 5/5
The ACA has shortcomings that need to be fixed, but one provision that must remain is the protection of individuals with #preexistingconditions. Our legislation would have kept that provision while simultaneously making improvements that could lower premiums up to 30%. 4/5
My colleagues and I in the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus came up with a solution last Congress to address this by creating a "dedicated stability fund" that states could use to cut premium costs, especially for those with pre-existing conditions. 3/5
Experts attribute the decline in part to actions by the Trump administration to undermine the #ACA, including the decision to eliminate ‚Äúcost share reduction‚Äù payments. This has put the cost of ACA policies out of reach for middle class Americans not receiving a subsidy. 2/5
2018 Census data released today shows that for the first time since 2010, the number of Americans without health insurance increased from the year before. The numbers are very concerning. 1/5

I‚Äôm disappointed that the DuPage County court has ruled that Sterigenics can reopen in Willowbrook. I've said all along that @epa should shut down #Sterigenics until we're assured that it's not a threat to public health. We're not there. We need to protect our communities. https://t.co/ntAeLP9KoY

My prayers are w/ the #Midland &amp; #Odessa communities. Yesterday‚Äôs shootings were another tragic reminder of what happens when no action is taken on commonsense gun legislation. The Senate must pass the #backgroundcheck bill when we return from recess. Our country demands reform.
