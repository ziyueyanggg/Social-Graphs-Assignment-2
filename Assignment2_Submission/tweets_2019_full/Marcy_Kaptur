If the President expects the #USMCA to be ratified by Congress, he should amend the text of the agreement to include equal labor standards and enforcement mechanisms as are referenced in this legislation.
My bill requires any trade agreement include enforceable labor standards and protections; sets Congress‚Äô expectations that objectives will apply to all workers regardless of immigration status, and establishes collective bargaining standards across borders.

This system undermines the rule of law w/ a global race to the bottom. Trade is not just about goods. It's about people. It's about workers. It's about communities. Unfortunately, President Trump‚Äôs renegotiated NAFTA 2.0 does little to remedy the mistakes of the original NAFTA.
