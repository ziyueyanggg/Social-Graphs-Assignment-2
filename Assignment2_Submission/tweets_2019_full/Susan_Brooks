Although the development of vaccines &amp; drugs is a challenging process, our current vaccines are based on significantly outdated research &amp; it is critically important we take action to modernize our influenza vaccines in this country. Complete statement: https://t.co/JddCy8czPb
It has been +100yrs since the 1918 pandemic influenza killed millions of people around the world &amp; 675k people in the US. This flu season,+50 #Hoosiers lost their lives because of the seasonal flu.
Specifically, I applaud the establishment of the National Influenza Vaccine Task Force who will be focused on implementing updates to our influenza vaccine enterprise so that it is highly responsible, flexible, scalable &amp; more effective at preventing the spread of #flu viruses.
I am proud this executive order further solidifies our commitment to better prepare Americans across the country with influenza vaccines that could save their lives. https://t.co/pCy34DdsSX
