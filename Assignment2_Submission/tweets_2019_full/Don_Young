As a veteran myself, I’m very proud to have four fellow veterans on my staff, and I’m grateful that three of them were able to join me today. There is no way we can fully repay them for their service, but these care packages are just one small way to remind our troops of home.

Renewable energy is a key component of American energy independence, and Alaskans have my commitment that I’ll continue working to ensure that development in all forms is supported.
This bill was also signed into law, ensuring Alaska continues to have the resources available to expand renewable hydro projects. Read more about that legislation here: https://t.co/M80V2cTezn
Additionally, I authored legislation to correct an error made by the federal gov't that was preventing 25 acres of land from being utilized for the Swan Lake Hydro Project in Southeast.

I am relieved that Alaskans have a Republican team in the Senate to protect our economy and land-use rights. Together, I’ll keep working with the Alaska Delegation to defend against the extreme partisan interests that seek to destroy jobs and opportunity within our state.
This bill passed the House but make no mistake: it will not pass the Senate; it will not become law; it will serve only the interests of environmental lawyers and the ultra-liberal politicians who support these disastrous policies.
The 1002 Area of #ANWR was specifically set aside by Congress for resource exploration. Every Governor, Senator, and Congressman from Alaska – Republican, Democrat, and Independent – have supported exploration in our state, but House Democrats simply aren’t listening.
Today, @HouseDemocrats passed a sham bill. It’s all political theater -- a show -- and they know it. These politicians don’t think we can take care of our own state. It’s time for Alaskans to be allowed to take care of Alaska. https://t.co/vsapGyv67k

I wish OceansAlaska and their dedicated scientists continued success in the hatching seasons ahead. It was also great to meet with entrepreneur Markos Scheer whose startup, Premium Aquatics, is another important voice in mariculture.
OceansAlaska is an innovator in the mariculture industry, and has helped raise Ketchikan’s profile as a leading destination for raising shellfish and getting them to market. I appreciated the chance to tour their nursery and learn more about the economic impact of their efforts. https://t.co/jmUNJPAe65
