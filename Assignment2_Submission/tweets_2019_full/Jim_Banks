But Zuckerberg went beyond flattery. In 2016, reports broke that Facebook was covertly developing software to censor content in specific regions.

If @Apple feels obliged to remove content it feels may facilitate harm to law enforcement, I'm curious to hear Apple's thoughts on apps used by extremist groups here in the U.S. , like Antifa, to mobilize &amp; achieve similar objectives &amp; whether those apps should be moderated too.
This is also not the first time Apple has yielded to China. 
 
Apple just removed the Taiwanese flag emoji from its keyboard for users in Hong Kong &amp; Macau. 
 
In 2017 Apple removed from its app store 600+ virtual private network apps allowing users to evade censorship in China.
Apple first rejected @hkmaplive, then approved it after criticism across the U.S. and Europe, only to then remove it after criticism from China. 
 
Evidently, not all criticism is created equal.
 
Why is China's market pressure taking precedence over that of the West?
Yet another American company bends to the dictates of the Chinese Communist Party.
 
Now it‚Äôs @Apple who self-censors to not offend CCP apparatchiks at the expense of pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong.

Here are a few examples showcasing the pattern... The @NBA boycotted North Carolina over their bathroom policy, but they're silent when #China puts Muslims in internment camps.
