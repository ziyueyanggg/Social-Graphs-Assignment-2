Thanks to the County‚Äôs steadfast support, we have expanded the youth suicide prevention program to 35 schools throughout the San Gabriel Valley and southeast LA County. The program serves as a model for my legislation, the Mental Health Services for Students Act (H.R. 1109).
18 years ago, I secured federal funding to place local mental health provider, Pacific Clinics, in one high school and three middle schools in LA County; one of these schools was Martha‚Äôs.
Martha went through a stage of darkness when she came to terms w/ her sexuality at age 15 and felt confused, fearful, guilty, sad &amp; lonely, as many LGBTQ youth do. A close friend reached out to her, understood her, supported her, and encouraged her to seek mental health services.
I invite you to read my Op-Ed on the importance of funding mental health services in schools for youth like Martha, an 18 y/o Latina college student from La Puente. https://t.co/7sU0xy2soL
