As my Democrat colleagues project outrage, please remember: they announced an impeachment inquiry *before* having read the call transcript, *without* knowing the details of the complaint

The details are not relevant to them. They are an impeachment party in search of validation.
If all we‚Äôre going to hear from is a witness spreading third-hand hearsay...

There's no reason to view this leaked call as anything other than a continued effort from within to undermine both POTUS and an imminent FISA IG report, expected to be damning toward the Intel Community
Lost in all of the Ukraine controversy: this is such an egregious breach of trust with the IC. 

How can a President exercise his constitutional duties if his calls are being politically leaked? How can foreign leaders trust us if they know this could happen?

It is appalling.
I‚Äôve read the ‚Äòwhistleblower‚Äô complaint. It‚Äôs a collection of speculative, third-hand accounts with press clippings and no serious evidence. The call transcript itself shows the complaint to be largely inaccurate.

We‚Äôve seen this movie before, folks. It‚Äôs Russian collusion 2.0.

Wow. The full Ukraine call transcript shows @realDonaldTrump asking Ukraine's President for a "favor," helping investigate 2016 election interference. CNN cut the clip making it look like the "favor" was about investigating Biden.

Wow. https://t.co/wn5uSpKnoS

We would all be better off if we had an honest conversation about what Democrats are trying to impeach President Trump for‚Äîthat is, the high crime and misdemeanor of winning the 2016 election
As the left now tries to move the goalposts, remember that for days, all we heard was that @realDonaldTrump offered quid pro quo to trade foreign aid in exchange for investigating the Bidens. 

It was wrong. Again. Another day, another conspiracy theory debunked.

Seeing some try to spin this section of the call into "quid pro quo" and it's laughable. To put it mildly. https://t.co/ELkGXDvYmA
Blatantly false and misleading tweet. The "favor" President Trump mentions is in regards to helping investigate 2016 election meddling.

Only after President Zelensky brings up Rudy Giuliani and "the investigation" does the Biden conversation happen. https://t.co/1gbTlFFQbC
So we're clear, the "favor" being referenced here is that Ukraine look into 2016 election meddling (which involved Russia and Ukraine)... something Democrats have demanded the President do for 3 years now! https://t.co/1l3NnsIGbK
Seeing some political conflation about two sections of the report:

The "favor" section of the call is referencing "crowdstrike," or an investigation into election interference. This is NOT the same thing as the Biden section.

Conflating the two is misleading and irresponsible
Remember yesterday when we were told President Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden's son? 8 times? And offered quid pro quo in exchange?

None of that was true. They did it again.

Just like collusion. Just like obstruction. Same old story.
I've read the transcript and the Democrat spin was wrong... again

- President Zelensky initiated the Giuliani convo and asked the WH to send him to Ukraine
- ZERO discussion of foreign aid quid pro quo

That's it? THAT'S what Democrats are impeaching on?

Give me a break.
So we are all clear what's happening: House Democrats are supposedly beginning an impeachment inquiry, and building it on an anonymous secondhand complaint they haven't seen... which describes a call transcript that they haven't read.

You can't make it up.
POTUS says he's releasing the full transcript of the Ukraine call, and amazingly Democrats now say the whistleblower complaint is more important

Folks, the 'whistleblower' wasn't on the call

They think a secondhand account of the call will tell you more than the *actual call*
This Ukraine story is peak Swamp in action
 
We have actual video evidence of Joe Biden acknowledging quid pro quo corruption involving his son and Ukraine
 
But no‚Äîthe left instead focuses on Trump, armed with only secondhand hearsay and zero evidence
 
This is not serious
