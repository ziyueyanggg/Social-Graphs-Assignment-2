Just read the “impeachment” resolution. I look forward to questioning Adam Schiff about the work he does behind closed doors, per the Ken Starr standard.

Democrats can’t un-poison the well.

✓ The labor force participation rate is strong.

We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the brave special forces who conducted the raid and to @realDonaldTrump for his strong leadership in dismantling the ISIS caliphate.

Every American should celebrate this major victory in the war on terror.
Today is a great day for our country, and a great day for the world. Baghdadi was the epitome of inhumanity, and his death sends a strong message that the U.S. will always seek justice against those who inflict evil on the world.

Republicans continue to focus on safeguarding our elections and have offered concrete solutions to do just that:
 
The DETER Act
The Defending the Integrity of Voting Systems Act
 
What are Democrats focused on? → More empty investigations. https://t.co/1UObAZ3uiJ
Another day, another installment of misinformation. The House has not voted to begin a formal impeachment inquiry, and Twitter assertions don’t change that. https://t.co/S64Oy5N758
I applaud Chief Judge Howell’s decision today. Democrats’ pending cases involve distinct issues of law and fact and should not be combined.

McGahn's lawyer made it clear McGahn "does not believe he witnessed any violation of law" &amp; @POTUS told him "to cooperate fully with the special counsel." Are Democrats too married to impeachment to accept Mueller's report or believe McGahn's own counsel? https://t.co/JU1RUdPJYv
America is a nation of immigrants because it offers everyone the freedom to be self-sufficient and successful. @DHSgov's final rule will let immigrants pursue the American dream without overly burdening U.S. taxpayers, who are also working hard for their dreams.
When it comes to holding the president accountable, Democrats seem to believe that the ends justify their means. In reality, they may do more to harm our democracy than any president ever could. https://t.co/kycs3dJsbe
We all have different visions for #immigrationreform, &amp; sometimes compromise feels like failure, but, today, the only winners in this border debacle are gangs &amp; criminals who traffic drugs &amp; humans. 
 
Our committee is ground zero for solutions. Why aren’t we considering them?
Chairman Nadler is either uniformed about what a formal impeachment inquiry is or he is deliberately misleading the American public to score cheap political points. Which is it, Chairman? #moveon https://t.co/OYa3euFPEz
For the good of the Americans who elected Congress to deliver real solutions, it’s time to accept that no Americans conspired with Russia and to return to legislating with confidence. https://t.co/kmV6AaEVuN
The #FixtheImmigrationLoopholesAct has three main provisions to repair policies fueling the border surge, &amp; two of those come straight from President Obama’s playbook. The only real solution is to pass a bill.

Democrats aren’t in an impeachment inquiry because they know the American people don’t want it and the facts don’t support it. Period. End of story.

Just another distraction from the failed Democrat agenda.
Democrats' legal action is sure to fail, weakening Congress’s ability to conduct oversight now and into the future. They want to convince their base they’re wedded to impeachment even after this week, but a baseless legal claim is an odd way to show that.

In #GA09, a federal court dismissed charges against a defendant for unregistered possession of ricin because current law didn't categorize the toxin appropriately.

Join us at 9 am!
Join @JudyWoodruff and me on @NewsHour tonight at 6:15 to discuss the House Judiciary hearing with former special counsel Robert #Mueller.
Holding hearings while ignoring legislative solutions extends the border crisis. Obama and Trump Administrations saw the problem, and lawmakers can help end the crisis by taking up bills like the #FixtheImmigrationLoopholesAct. https://t.co/EdE0jq78Rp
Here we are again, as the border crisis rages on, we’re having yet another oversight hearing that will deliver zero solutions to protect migrant children, won’t secure our southern border, and doesn't close a single policy loophole. https://t.co/vCA50f80nK
With the Mueller case closed, I hope we can begin solving the actual problems facing this country. https://t.co/Q1hjwgLjN6

Special Counsel Robert Mueller: “The investigation did not establish members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in the election interference activities.”
If we carry anything away today, it must be that we increase our vigilance against foreign election interference while we ensure our government officials don’t weaponize their power against the constitutional rights guaranteed to every United States citizen.
Russia meddled in the 2016 election. The president did not conspire with Russians. Nothing we hear today will change those facts. But one element of this story remains: the beginnings of the FBI investigation into the president.
After an extended, unhampered investigation, today marks an end to Mueller’s involvement in an investigation that closed in April. The burden of proof for accusations that remain unproven is extremely high—especially in light of the special counsel’s thoroughness.
RT @HouseGOP: The Dems’ emphasis on today’s testimony reveals they’ve got no other card to play on impeachment than the report itself, whic…RT @The Dems’ emphasis on today’s testimony reveals they’ve got no other card to play on impeachment than the report itself, which found no collusion. @RepDougCollins is right: It’s time to move on. https://t.co/ATeHSWEBgL
If Judiciary Democrats want to convince America their vendetta against the White House is more noble than solving the border crisis or growing the job market, today’s hearing is their last chance.
https://t.co/yO5XVifZps
A last-minute witness would jeopardize whether tomorrow's hearing complies with House Rules.

If Dems believe it's the special counsel’s responsibility to testify to his report, they have no ground for outsourcing that duty at the expense of our committee’s integrity.

I appreciate news the chairman has taken seriously the concerns Judiciary Republicans raised this week. The new format will allow all Judiciary Republicans to question the special counsel on July 24.
Dr. John Eastman today urged lawmakers “to accept the closing of the investigation by the Mueller team, to accept the results of the last election, and to get on with the business of actually addressing through legislation many of the serious problems our nation currently faces.”
For nearly six decades, Congress has come together &amp; put politics aside to protect our national security. 

Today, House Democrats changed the course of history &amp; turned their backs on our troops.

Our men &amp; women in uniform deserve better. #NDAA
Instead of solving America’s problems or appreciating its successes, we’re spending today reciting obvious legal processes and avoiding our duty to legislate. https://t.co/bMqXotnyrp

After Dems denied the #BorderCrisis for months, Nadler today claims there's "child abuse" &amp; "negligent homicide &amp; systematic torture of children at the border.” It's incredible Dems oppose efforts to end the crisis, then misrepresent it &amp; blame shift when @POTUS offers solutions. https://t.co/jWU4l8kSkj
When @RepMarthaRoby asked the chairman what the format of the Mueller hearing is and why, the chairman told her that’s outside the scope of this markup...a markup specifically authorizing subpoenas related to the Mueller investigation. Simple questions get no answer. #Mindblowing
