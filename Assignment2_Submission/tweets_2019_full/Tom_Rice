Congratulations to the @Nationals on their 2019 World Series Win! They never gave up.
Unemployment is at record lows. 1,064,243 jobs hang in the balance as long as #USMCA is not ratified. It would easily pass Congress but Democrats are too busy trying to impeach @realDonaldTrump. It‚Äôs time for @SpeakerPelosi to put country before party: it‚Äôs time to pass #USMCA!
. @realdonaldtrump and pro-growth Republican policies have supercharged our economy and all Americans are benefiting. Thank you President Trump! https://t.co/up6iOQ42Fg
The death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is a victory for the American people. Thank you President Trump. Thank you to our Special Forces who carried out the raid. They are the finest in the world and their bravery and dedication is unparalleled. üá∫üá∏

Saddened to learn of the passing of my collegue, Rep. Elijah Cummings. He was a dedicated public servant who will be greatly missed by many. Sending prayers to his family and loved ones during this time.
The impeachment process started the day after the election, and it‚Äôs time for the Democrats to put the American people before their political interests.
It has been 313 days since the President signed the USMCA with Mexico and Canada. And yet still no vote. 

Instead, the Democrats continue to try to undo the 2016 election. They struck out with the Kavanaugh hearings and they struck out with the Mueller Investigation.
President Trump has the bases loaded with record low unemployment rates, 2% GDP growth and a competitive economy once again. 

However, Speaker Pelosi is denying the American people the grand slam they deserve by not bringing USMCA to the House floor for a vote.
Huge news: Unemployment has reached a 50 year low! We will keep focused on growing our economy and creating opportunity! https://t.co/AAOFgCcA4L

Democrats have tried and failed to relitigate the 2016 election since the day President Trump was sworn into office. While they continue their political attacks, we will keep our focus on improving the lives of Americans and South Carolinians.
It‚Äôs disappointing but not surprising that the Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry based on an unverified second-hand account, rather than waiting 24 hours for President Trump‚Äôs voluntary release of the full transcript of the phone call.
Great news! Darlington will receive a $1.2 million federal grant to improve critical system infrastructure and strengthen the local economy.

(4/4) Wrenzie and I are praying for the victims and their families and are grateful for the bravery of the first responders whose quick action saved countless lives.
(3/4) We also must address the rise of hatred in our culture that is plaguing our country. No one should be scared when they go to school, their place of worship, or to the store.
(2/4) I have introduced bipartisan legislation that would close the ‚ÄúCharleston Loophole‚Äù and ensure law enforcement has all relevant information at their disposal to quickly determine if someone should be allowed to purchase a gun.
(1/4) Our nation is shaken by the tragedies in Texas and Ohio. We must unite against this senseless violence and condemn hatred in any form. Congress should work in a bipartisan fashion to close loopholes that allow sick people to have firearms.

This burden will be shouldered by our children and grandchildren, and my constituents deserve better.
A two year suspension on the debt-limit will put us right back here in two years. We need to fix the broken process that got us here and make the tough decisions required to balance our budget.
I could not support yesterday's budget bill, which will add nearly $2 trillion to the federal debt over the next 10 years. At a time when we need to rein in our spending, this bill keeps us on an unsustainable path.

I invite the entire @postandcourier editorial board to come up from Charleston and join me in the Seventh District so that they can see with their own eyes why we need I-73.
You love to complain about the corridor of shame, but you don‚Äôt want to do anything to bring opportunity to this depressed region. People in my district are tired of being left behind!
Agriculture and tourism remain South Carolina‚Äôs biggest industries and the Pee Dee and Grand Strand produce an inordinately large portion of both. But we can‚Äôt grow without infrastructure and I-73 is the best investment we can make for our region and our state.
Wow. Why is the @postandcourier so hell bent against bringing opportunity to our state??

Going forward, I hope Democrats focus less on political maneuvers and more on legitimate solutions to secure our border so that we can bring an end to the humanitarian and national security crisis we‚Äôre facing.
Even though the Senate passed a bipartisan bill to address the humanitarian crisis at our border that President Trump promised to sign, House Dems scrambled to sink this bill. Speaker Pelosi finally caved and Democrats voted with us to send important resources to the border.
It‚Äôs been eight weeks since @realDonaldTrump requested emergency funding to address the humanitarian crisis for the border, but Democrats sat on their hands until the eleventh hour.
