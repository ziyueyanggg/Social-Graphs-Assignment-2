@gul_garak It‚Äôs a little more expensive than corrugated metal roofing but if you use standing seam metal, you can clamp solar panels to the roof without putting holes in your roof, and won‚Äôt have to buy so much mounting hardware.

The Neocons and the deep state folks are not going to like this truth bomb from @realDonaldTrump, but he‚Äôs right and the American people know it (the ones outside of the beltway!). To have someone in the Whitehouse who will actually state these facts this is refreshing. https://t.co/Y8wDcDK8h6

@phil_luttazi @RZ_3_ @conor_leland CO2 is plant food. Higher concentrations result in better plant growth and lower water usage by plants. No one should be taken seriously unless they discuss this reality when discussing externalities associated with CO2 production/ release.

@ATFederation I‚Äôm more interested in piezo effect‚Äôs cousin the seebeck effect, but I don‚Äôt think either is practical at scales that matter for home power, based on my calcs and commercially available devices.
@RZ_3_ @phil_luttazi @conor_leland The best way to know whether you‚Äôre having a pragmatic conversation about CO2 levels is if the person you‚Äôre talking to has considered the positive effects of more CO2 as well as any negative effects.

@BaberRaza1 Tesla Model S battery is rated at 85kWhr, so roughly 3 days (72hrs) at 1kW, or 1 day at 3kWhr, with inefficiencies included.  We run AC now 24/7 with these batteries but didn‚Äôt do that with lead acid batteries.

@phil_luttazi @conor_leland Yes, by people who can‚Äôt even solve a differential equation but think they know how the earth‚Äôs climate works... and that they can make it better by taxing their neighbors.
@SchmittCraig The battery was $15k and I used $2k in parts to connect it up to our existing solar and inverter setup.  All in, it‚Äôs still more expensive than grid power, but someone has to experiment, right?
