#Equalpay is not just a women’s issue. It impacts our families,  businesses &amp; economy. It’s time for the Senate to take up and pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct, which brings us one step closer to economic security for women and families. #EqualPayDay
.@IowaCASA- As a longtime supporter of #VAWA and cosponsor of #HR1585, I will proudly be voting YES this week! Thanks for all that you do to advocate on behalf of Iowans! https://t.co/Z9nS4ixCZZ
Amazing win for the @IowaWBB team! They punched their ticket to the Elite Eight! #MarchMadness2019

Iowa Democrats Call on Trump Administration to Halt Efforts to Strike Down ACA Protections https://t.co/nOrJtxG1ZT
As a longtime supporter of funding for @specialolympics, it is disheartening that the @usedgov's budget would eliminate funding that supports this important org and the kids who participate. I’ll fight to protect these critical funds!
ICYMI: Overnight, the Trump Admin moved to take away coverage for preexisting conditions, reinstate caps on coverage, reopen the Medicare Rx donut hole and kick young adults off their parent's care. We have to fight against this! https://t.co/GOHmtrvZVu
I’m pleased the administration has quickly approved the request for federal assistance for the counties facing massive floods. This is a necessary first step towards recovery.
And the @IowaWBB team moves on as well! Congrats on making it to the second round of the #NCAATournament!
Moving on! Congrats to the @IowaHoops team on their first round win!
When the floods of 2008 devastated Eastern Iowa, it didn't matter where you are from. Iowans have a history of coming together when there is a natural disaster and this is no different. I will also be sending a letter in support of the disaster declaration today! https://t.co/mwdigXyoW7
Also, good luck to the @CycloneWBB and @IowaWBB teams who begin their #NCAATournament games today and Saturday! #MarchMadness
It's the big day! Good luck to @IowaHoops and @CycloneMBB in their opening round games of the #NCAATournament! #MarchMadness

Once again, the @EPA granted additional small refinery waivers to companies who are not facing financial hardships. These waivers are an attack on the #RFS &amp; Iowa farmers. They must end! https://t.co/UqzWHzEN4J
#NationalAgDay is a day to celebrate all that our farmers provide for people around the world. From food and fuel to clothing and beyond, the incredible contributions from America's farmers deserve our appreciation!
Ensuring #LGBT Americans and their families are protected from discrimination is an essential priority, which is why I am proud to join more than 200 members to help introduce the #EqualityAct. This bill ensures LGBT individuals are fully protected under our civil rights laws!
After passing tax giveaways for the wealthy &amp; corporations, the #TrumpBudget puts the burden of deficit reduction on the backs of our farmers by cutting $28 BILLION in commodity programs &amp; crop insurance!

Congrats to the Oskaloosa boys basketball team for winning the 3A state title! @OskyActivities @IHSAA #ia02
On his way out, EPA Admin Pruitt completely disregarded the law &amp; gave handouts to large oil cos who make MILLIONS in profits each year. The waivers were meant to support small, economically challenged refiners, not Exxon! It's a direct attack on the RFS and our farmers!

10 yrs ago, I was proud to help get the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act signed into law. Today I am pleased to help reintro the #PaycheckFairness Act to ensure women are paid the same as their male colleagues. We must ensure #EqualPay for equal work!

Additionally, Farm Service Agency offices were closed because of the shutdown, cutting off access to assistance with loans and tax prep. Glad to hear some offices are reopening, but Congress needs to end the shutdown and reopen these offices for good. https://t.co/ivBD3tbQ1m
