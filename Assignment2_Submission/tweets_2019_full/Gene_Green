Baghdadi was a beheader of Christians, rapist of women, and enslaver of women; he was worse than a dog.

It was an honor to be named to the #NDAA Conference Committee. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that America's sons and daughters are the best trained and the best equipped--and that when they go to war, it's never a fair fight. https://t.co/KTZDSHvZ7G

President @realDonaldTrump is right.  Iran is lashing out and attacking drones, tankers, and now the world‚Äôs energy supply because the sanctions are working.  We must hold Iran accountable and continue to place pressure on Tehran until we see an end to this pattern of aggression. https://t.co/anc3UPNqi2
9/11 brings back a lot of memories for all of us. I'll never forget where I was when I first saw the towers burning. I knew immediately I was going to war. #NeverForget https://t.co/LOfKelNSB0

As an ER doc &amp; Special Ops flight surgeon, @AOC‚Äôs infamous claims about CBP facilities were very concerning. I‚Äôve taken the oath to do no harm. If true, we needed to take action immediately. I went to El Paso to see for myself. Nevertheless, that was not the case.
The Far Left, like @AOC, are demonizing the brave men and women of @CBP and @ICEgov at every turn. That is wrong. They should be commended and we should join Pres. @realDonaldTrump in giving them the resources they need. https://t.co/o94lFE5ZsT
