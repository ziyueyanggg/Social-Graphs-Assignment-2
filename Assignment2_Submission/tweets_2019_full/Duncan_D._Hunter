Important lesson we have learned from previous wildfires, the State of California must request federal military assets as soon as possible.  My attached letter to Governor Newsom outlines what assets are available now to join the fight. @realDonaldTrump @GavinNewsom https://t.co/BXPkU2osM6
FIRE UPDATE (2) - Additionally, I have contacted the White House requesting that appropriate military assets be provided to Naval Air Station Point Magu for training purposes, thereby making them available should the State of CA declare an emergency.
FIRE UPDATE...Sawday fire near Ramona and Julian remains at 70 acres, 5% contained. A new fire has been reported near Valley Center of 6 acres around Miller Lane and Cole Grade Lane. Please stay tuned to local media broadcasts for evacuations and road closures.

#PromisesMadePromisesKept

#NeverForget 
#September11
#NationalDayOfService
(3/4) My story is not unique, I am not special, many others joined and served for the exact same reasons.  But I believe our purpose is special and our purpose is unique; America is worth fighting for.
(2/4) I joined the military because I wanted to do everything I could to ensure Americans would never face that type of threat again.  The US Marine Corps taught me everything about service, dedication, fortitude and the commitment to never, ever, leave those by my side.
(1/4) It is rare when you can identify a specific day that changes both your life, but also the Nation you love.  September 11, 2001, is one of those days for me and because of the terrorist acts that took so many American lives, I signed up with the US Marine Corps the next day. https://t.co/MC1pngCq0t
