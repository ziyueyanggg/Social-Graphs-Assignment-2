Denying 99% of loan-forgiveness requests is unacceptable.  For this reason, today I joined @RepJimmyPanetta to introduce the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Modernization Act to ensure our public servants receive the loan forgiveness they were promised. https://t.co/kt2rwf33D1 https://t.co/iSjZJxsTww
This PSA reminds us of the true impact gun violence has on our communities, especially children.  More than 200 days ago, the House passed bipartisan legislation to expand background checks.  

It‚Äôs time for @SenateMajLdr to #DoSomething to #EndGunViolence. https://t.co/4S494hKuRR
I‚Äôm proud to help advance two bills out of @EdLaborCmte today:

‚úÖThe School Shooting Safety &amp; Preparedness Act enhances data collection on school shootings 

‚úÖThe Dignity in Aging Act increases funding for food assistance, transportation, and other services for older Americans
September is National Preparedness Month.  Community Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) train volunteers to prepare for the disasters their community may face.  #BeReady by finding local CERTs in Northeast Ohio today: https://t.co/DNznvzHgRY
The Administration‚Äôs latest environmental rollback will make it easier for polluters to contaminate wetlands, rivers and the Great Lakes.  We must protect our waterways and ensure everyone has access to clean drinking water. #ProtectCleanWater https://t.co/XczywUXZTK
Nearly 6 million students are enrolled at Minority-Serving Institutions across the U.S.  I‚Äôm proud to join with my colleagues in the House to pass legislation that will ensure students of color attending HBCUs, TCUs and MSIs continue to have access to a quality education. https://t.co/7TjOBnCI9A
Thanks to the leaders of the @NPHCHQ and all MOCs, including @RepKarenBass &amp; @RepZoeLofgren, who attended the 10th Annual Presidents Forum last week.  By raising our collective voices to restore voting rights, we will ensure all Americans have unfettered access to the ballot box. https://t.co/aaeAkZ4Wdy
The rule is a continuation of the Administration's anti-immigrant policies and will restrict LEGAL immigration to the U.S. I am proud to cosponsor the No Federal Funds for Public Charge Act, a bill to block funds from being used to implement this new policy. #NoToPublicCharge
The Administration‚Äôs #PublicCharge rule is a cruel attack on immigrant families.  Millions of legal immigrants will be forced to choose between obtaining a visa and accessing critical assistance including SNAP, public housing, and Medicaid. https://t.co/JxVrgEIoAm
This #HispanicHeritageMonth, we celebrate the diversity and rich traditions of Hispanic Americans. Our nation is stronger thanks to the many cultural and economic contributions from Hispanic and Latino communities across the United States. https://t.co/JxBHhG6tnO
The Violence Against Women Act became the law 25 years ago today.  In April, the House passed a 5-year reauthorization and expansion of #VAWA to continue to protect victims of domestic violence.  It‚Äôs time for @SenateMajLdr to allow a vote on this critical piece of legislation.
This report makes one thing clear ‚Äì obesity rates in America continue to rise.  As Co-Chair of the Congressional Taskforce on Childhood Obesity, the health and safety of our children remains a top priority.

This report is evidence federal safety net programs are working! In 2018, SNAP kept three million people out of poverty.  We must resist the Administration‚Äôs attempts to gut programs that effectively support families and eliminate poverty. https://t.co/RV7I1hs0Ui

Today, @theblackcaucus observed the 400th anniversary of the first arrival of enslaved Africans to American shores.

It‚Äôs been nearly 200 days since the House passed legislation to strengthen background checks.

Another 200,000+ Ohioans were purged from voter rolls today, even after multiple errors were discovered on the state's lists.  This is voter suppression in action.  

Every American has the unfettered and unabridged right to vote! #StopThePurge https://t.co/ivA78uEk2M
One in six people in Northeast Ohio lack reliable access to food. On this National Food Bank Day, consider supporting local food banks like @CleFoodBank &amp; @ACRFoodbank that fight hunger and help families put food on the table. #HungerActionMonth https://t.co/I7aT8zfSni
NEW: @USDA‚Äôs plan to limit SNAP eligibility strips 61,000 Ohio households of SNAP benefits, including over 16,000 households with children.  

Ensuring families receive nutritious meals is reason enough for the Administration to keep its #HandsOffSNAP. https://t.co/QpfnxoIQZa
This is the latest example of the Administration‚Äôs disregard for student borrowers. The Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is meant to support public servants, yet countless individuals are being shortchanged on the loan forgiveness they were promised. https://t.co/qej24LZk0f
#DACA has helped over 800K young people legally work, go to college, and build successful lives here in the US.  As I fight to #ProtectTheDream in Congress, I encourage DACA recipients in my community to keep their status up to date. Renew yours today: https://t.co/JmH5VW2PEZ

Cuyahoga County had an estimated 440 opioid-related deaths in 2018.

U.S. household food insecurity has dropped to its lowest level in ten years, proving the success of Federal nutrition programs.

While our seniors are going hungry, the Administration‚Äôs budget proposes to eliminate the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which provides over 675,000 low-income seniors with healthy foods. We should strengthen these programs, not gut them. https://t.co/McsqydRJlw

As new relaxed gun laws go into effect today in Texas, this tragedy is yet another example of why @senatemajldr must #DoSomething to prevent these acts of violence from reoccurring.
As authorities continue to update the public on the shooting in West Texas, my prayers remain with the officers, victims, their families, and the communities of Midland and Odessa, Texas.
Despite this success, the Administration has proposed a new rule that will take food out of the mouths of millions of people. 

This proposal will hurt seniors and families who rely on SNAP to put food on the table. #HandsOffSNAP
Today marks the 55th anniversary of President Lyndon B. Johnson signing the Food Stamp Act into law.  Today, SNAP is the country's most effective anti-hunger program, feeding nearly 40 million Americans in 2018.
In July, I was proud to support legislation to #RaiseTheWage.  The bill would gradually increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, lift over one million people out of poverty, and give nearly 33 million Americans the stability they deserve.  #LaborDay2019 https://t.co/iplkEtcb8v

There's only one way to challenge pay discrimination: change the law.  Earlier this year, the House passed the #PaycheckFairness Act, an important first step towards ensuring that Black women are paid fairly for their work. #PayBlackWomen https://t.co/Siqjh37IXm
This wage gap hurts Black women &amp; damages the economic security of Black families.  It's time for Congress to take concrete action to strengthen #equalpay protections and combat discriminatory pay practices. #BlackWomenCantWait for #PaycheckFairness
Black women working full-time, year-round earned only 61 cents for every dollar earned by white, non-Hispanic men in 2017.  Due to this wage gap, black women stand to lose nearly $1 million over a 40-year career. https://t.co/Pz4ltn3F99
