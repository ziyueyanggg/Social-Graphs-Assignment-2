In the House impeachment charade, Schiff has been judge, jury, liar, leaker &amp; witness coach. 

Good news: In the Senate, he's just going to be "some dude". Spoiler Alert: This will be DOA in Senate for best of reasons! @DevinNunes @RepByrne @IngrahamAngle

Nothing @DonLemon says here is true. A fact checker would rate this "Four Adam Schiffs". It‚Äôs crazy how much he loves dumbing down his audience this much every night. He should have his hero Schiff release the Vindman transcript ASAP! So incredibly dishonest. Both of them! https://t.co/MHkhy4XsAS
Schiff has himself a sneaky new trick for his impeachment charade here in his Capitol basement bunker. On top of being the prosecutor, judge AND jury in his self described grand jury, he‚Äôs trying out his witness coaching skills &amp; it‚Äôs a mess. This really is a Soviet style trial.
This impeachment resolution just introduced is fatally flawed. Just another awful misstep by House Dems running a circus, fueled by blind hate of the President, and lacking legitimacy, credibility, transparency and fairness. https://t.co/p3ImWe6xAd
Imagine how great it would be for the US if House Dems converted their blind enraged impeachment obsession into a positive effort to work w/ GOP and the President to pass USMCA, lower prescription drug prices, and so much more. Ripping our country in half like this is horrible.
Burisma, Joe Biden, Zlochevsky and Hunter Biden definitely shouldn‚Äôt get a free pass just bc Joe Biden is running for President. On top of Burisma and Zlochevsky‚Äôs other corruption, if the Biden family money scheme in Ukraine wasn‚Äôt illegal, then it should be.
Schiff‚Äôs not a magician. Taylor‚Äôs 2nd, 3rd &amp; 4th hand claims don‚Äôt become 1st hand just bc this slippery fella says so. Also, there‚Äôs a little problem w that pesky, inconvenient reality called ‚Äúthe other 99% of the story‚Äù. Schiff‚Äôs relying on Americans to be idiots. They aren‚Äôt. https://t.co/se9ifCmhOt
Pelosi now says there will be a vote Thu to authorize their impeachment inquiry. This should include minority subpoena rights, equal allocat. of staff, immediate release of all transcripts &amp; more. POTUS' counsel should be able to attend depos, present evidence &amp; quest. witnesses.
Mark is 100% spot on here. Ukraine didn‚Äôt even know there was a hold on aid until just before it was released. Schiff may be trying hard to write the world‚Äôs greatest parody, but it‚Äôs still just a parody. https://t.co/OF1PmJu7Jg
Schiff‚Äôs writing the world‚Äôs greatest parody. He will seek to connect dots that aren‚Äôt connected. It won‚Äôt be in a vacuum though &amp; the rest of the story will come out instantly. Facts aren‚Äôt on his side; just an imagination, blind hate &amp; sick willingness to insult intelligence.
Time to bring in the whistleblower and all of his anonymous sources who supposedly have first hand information to share. 

I‚Äôve got some questions to ask and holes to shine a bright light into.
When/If the transcripts ever get released, check out how he ridiculously leads witnesses. Too bad the stenographer won‚Äôt be adding ‚ÄúSchiff makes sad face‚Äù to the transcript every time that tactic has backfired on him during these depositions.
Adam Schiff says his impeachment inquiry is analogous to a grand jury investigation. Putting aside his cherry picked leaking &amp; outright lying, I‚Äôve never seen a grand jury investigation where the prosecutor was also the judge and the jury.

Just heard on CNN that the "impeachment inquiry" needs to be in Schiff's SCIF, bc what's being discussed includes CLASSIFIED info. That would have made some sense if not for the VERY specific instructions given out by Schiff every depo that NOTHING classified can be discussed.
House Members are being asked from constituents &amp; media about this "impeachment inquiry", but MOST are being kept in the dark regarding answers bc of how Schiff is running his Kangaroo Court. I may be in the SCIF w/others, but most House Members aren't. Show them the transcripts!

The best thing Congress can do is pass USMCA, lower prescription drug costs &amp; more. Instead the Pelosi/Schiff play call is a ridiculous, secretive ‚Äúimpeachment inquiry‚Äù lacking credibility, transparency or fairness. They are party over country turning their priorities inside out.
Impeachment was never intended to be used as a weapon just to topple a President bc you are sad you couldn‚Äôt win at the ballot box. Not in the USA! It‚Äôs painfully obvious that‚Äôs what this is really all about. House Dems will lose their majority over this next yr. A historic FAIL!

Schiff just said his super secret depositions are analogous to grand jury proceedings &amp; that's why it needs to be done out of public view in the Capitol basement. If that's the case, then why is he publicly leaking anything at all said he thinks can possibly be spun in his favor?
Adam Schiff is trying to get the US drunk on his favorite cocktail:

There are three main ingredients: (1) Cherry-picking leaks, (2) withholding key facts, and (3) outright lying.

I discussed this AM on @ThisWeekABC w @jonkarl https://t.co/3A0OmgQapS
NO ONE in the Obama admin was more conflicted out to run point w/ Ukraine than Joe Biden. Maybe the US needs to change laws to make sure this never happens again in the future. If that Biden family scheme in Ukraine w/Burisma &amp; Zlochevsky wasn‚Äôt illegal, then it should‚Äôve been.
@ThisWeekABC @jonkarl With no relevant experience, Hunter got paid 50k+ p/month by corrupt foreigners, solely bc he was the VP's son. VP Biden threatened Ukraine w/the loss of $1B if the state prosecutor wasn‚Äôt immediately fired, who btw, had an open case into Burisma/Zlochevsky. Those are ALL facts!
I don't believe Burisma, Joe Biden, Zlochevsky, or Hunter Biden should be immune from scrutiny just bc Joe Biden is running for POTUS. Pres Trump &amp; many others (myself included!) have a huge problem w/the Biden's shady arrangement in Ukraine.
@ThisWeekABC @jonkarl https://t.co/NX9bRWZLx1
On process and on substance, this ‚Äúimpeachment inquiry‚Äù has been a train wreck circus enthusiastically tearing the country in half, bc of people who still haven‚Äôt accepted the will of the American voters in 2016. Have a score to settle? Do it at the ballot box! https://t.co/Wtq9snJSd8
Amb Yovanovitch‚Äôs opening statement amounts to ~1/150th of yesterday‚Äôs deposition. Once again, these don‚Äôt need to be in secret in Schiff‚Äôs bunker in the Capitol basement. Release the transcripts (Volker too!), stop cherry picking leaks, withholding key facts &amp; outright lying!
Participated all day in the depo of former Amb Yovanovitch. Not ONE word uttered over several hrs behind closed doors deep in the Capitol basement couldn't/shouldn't have been asked &amp; answered live in front of YOU. Time for Pelosi/Schiff to invite the public into their clown show

House Dems should IMMEDIATELY release Amb Volker‚Äôs several hour long transcribed interview so ALL can read it.

1) Claims he &amp; his team weren‚Äôt in contact w whistleblower. Fact Check: ‚ùå

2) Said POTUS asked Zelensky to ‚Äúmanufacture dirt‚Äù on Bidens. Fact Check: ‚ùå

3) Reading to Congress of call transcript. Fact Check: ‚ùå

(still waiting for that Russia collusion evidence)
This impeachment process is a partisan clown show. The Dems are eagerly ripping our country in 1/2 for political expediency.

Meanwhile, despite precedent, NO VOTE, no minority subpoena power, POTUS‚Äô counsel not allowed at hearings to present evidence &amp; question witnesses, etc.
It's been 24 hrs &amp; the Volker transcript still hasn't been released by House Dems. No good reason why this hasn't been done yet. Anything to keep the Schiff quid pro quo fairy tale alive one more night. These tactics are unfair to the American public &amp; dividing our great country. https://t.co/xNTfJeEBUc
*wasnt until*
6) The hold was lifted &amp; aid released. 
According to Amb Volker's in depth testimony, at no point in time, from the initial hold to the release of the aid, was there any quid pro quo or other linkage between US aid &amp; Ukraine investigating the Bidens.
4) Amb Volker was in direct contact w Pres Zelensky &amp; his team in the weeks to follow &amp; they didn't mention anything to him about a hold on aid. It was until after the @politico story that they brought it up.
5) The aid was getting released regardless of any corruption inv.
2) In the readouts Amb Volker received of the call from not only the US gov't, but also the Ukraine gov't, there was no mention of aid being on hold or a quid pro quo.
3) When Amb Volker met w/Pres Zelensky on 7/26, there was no mention of aid on hold or a quid pro quo.
Amb Volker was VERY clear yesterday in his testimony that it is UNTRUE Pres Trump demanded a quid pro quo of Pres Zelensky that US aid was contingent upon an investigation by Ukraine into the Bidens:
1) Pres Zelensky had no knowledge aid was on hold at the time of the call.
Amb Volker just put a dagger in the heart of Schiff‚Äôs fairy tale claims of quid pro quo. While House Democrats may prefer cherry picking the Ambassador‚Äôs texts without the other 99% of the story, they should release the entire transcript of yesterday‚Äôs marathon interview ASAP!
Instead of House Dems releasing Ambassador Volker's texts drip by drip, just release all of his texts in Congress' possession right now as well as today's transcribed interview. Just give the media &amp; public EVERYTHING so Americans can form their own independent conclusions.
