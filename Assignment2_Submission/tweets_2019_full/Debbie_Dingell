John Conyers spent his life championing those causes. The fights John Conyers fought will be remembered for generations. I am deeply saddened by his passing. May God bring his family comfort during this difficult time.
John Conyers was a civil rights champion who served Michigan and the people of Detroit for decades. He began his career working for John Dingell, before running for Congress himself and they both believed in justice and equality for all.

This is our job. We still have the responsibility to lower drug prices for Americans, to get a trade deal that's going to help the hardworking men and women – and we have a moral responsibility to protect our Constitution.
We must use all Congressional authorities to follow the facts, launch an investigation, and uncover the truth. That is our moral responsibility. It is critical for the future of our democracy. That is why I support an impeachment inquiry into the President.
When someone is using appropriated funds designated for national security to threaten a world leader for their own personal and political gain – it cannot be ignored. It requires action. We need the facts.
It is our responsibility as Members of Congress to protect the United States of America. We take an oath to protect our Constitution and to protect our national security.
The law requires that potential threats such as this be provided to the Intelligence Committees of Congress and that has yet to happen.

Both domestic and foreign manufactures explicitly asked the President to not revoke the waiver. The industry needs certainty, not court cases that will last for years.
The American Auto industry is more fragile than many realize and at this moment volatile as well. Frankly, I’ve always said we need one set of standards that go well into the future and that increase year over year.
President Trump revoking California’s waver will take us in the wrong direction for every key metric for this industry, accomplish absolutely nothing, and cause serious and detrimental harm to an industry that needs support. https://t.co/19JbewotZv

Over 200 days. That’s how long ago the House passed universal background checks.

Since then El Paso, Dayton, and Odessa took the lives of too many innocent people. Not to mention the daily gun violence in Chicago, Detroit, and Baltimore.

That is why I have been pushing our leadership hard for a vote on the resolution supporting a two state solution and that the timing must be now.
We must send a strong signal that the United States cares about these children, and also send a strong message to Netanyahu that his statement last week on Palestine was dangerous, and shows Netanyahu has no intention of supporting a two state solution.
My heart has always been with the children of Palestine and I would never take action that would harm them. I believe we must act to protect them and that we must do better than this bill. I am working hard on a solution.
162 Days. That’s how long it’s been since the House reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act. 

The Senate still hasn’t scheduled a vote. 

On the 25th anniversary of this life saving legislation, McConnell must schedule a vote. Survivors needs support now.
162 days ago the House reauthorized VAWA. The Senate still hasn’t scheduled a vote. On the 25th anniversary of this life saving legislation, it'd be fitting for McConnell to schedule a vote. Survivors needs support now.
Without updates or support for the critical programs in VAWA we are moving backwards, good programs helping victims are losing critical funding and one more fear is being added to the pile survivors are dealing with. VAWA has always been a bipartisan effort.
We have broken down stigmas and more survivors are coming out of the shadows escaping abusive situations and seeking the support they need. Protecting and expanding this has been a priority for me since coming to Congress.
When I was a child, I remember the fear, the seeking help and no one responding because you didn’t acknowledge the problem or accept the reality of what happened behind closed doors. Much has changed since those days and the passage of VAWA in 1994.
25 years ago we passed the Violence Against Women Act and recognized that no woman, no child and no family should fear for their life because of domestic violence. But before that, many lived with that fear. Including myself.
Protective orders can mean life and death for many. But too often, abusers can evade them. That’s why we must bring our judicial system into the 21st century and deliver protective orders electronically. Survivors need support now.
