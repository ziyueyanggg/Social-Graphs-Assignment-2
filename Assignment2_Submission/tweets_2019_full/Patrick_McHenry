Beyond his work as a public servant, I’ll always think of Greg for his commitment to his family. He is a devoted husband and father who has always put his family first. I wish Greg and Mylene all the best as they move on to this next stage of their lives.
He helped maintain our historic majorities while leading the NRCC and later helped shepherd consequential legislation—like the SUPPORT Act—to passage as Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.
.@repgregwalden is unquestionably one of the most intelligent and substantive members with whom I’ve served during my time in Congress. For the past two decades, he’s been on the frontlines of some of our party's most important political and policy battles.
