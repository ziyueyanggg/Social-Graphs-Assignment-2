By connecting the dots, if disgraced @RepAdamSchiff had advance knowledge of the complaint, it could mean:
- the ‚Äúwhistleblower‚Äù was likely coordinating the effort to undermine @realDonaldTrump w/ Schiff
- He knew all along that the complaint was not credible &amp; based on hearsay. https://t.co/tXSWBwkzZD
The Intel Community changed the rules so that secondhand hearsay can form the basis of whistleblower complaints.

Shortly afterwards, this complaint against @realDonaldTrump surfaces, and it is based on ‚Äì you guessed it ‚Äì secondhand hearsay.

Sound like a set up to anyone? https://t.co/0ZH0pu35zJ

Incredibly suspicious that the requirement for whistleblower complaints to have first-hand knowledge is removed days before the story breaks.

.@HouseDemocrats in 2019:

- @RepAdamSchiff blatantly fabricating quotes from @realDonaldTrump;
- @RepJerryNadler, the ringleader of the collusion delusion circus;
- @SpeakerPelosi launching impeachment inquiries based on zero evidence and second-hand gossip.

Morally bankrupt!
.@HouseDemocrats just passed legislation benefiting illegal immigrants‚Äô healthcare over the needs of our veterans and military servicemembers.

The Left‚Äôs priorities are so far out of touch that it‚Äôs shameful.
#ImpeachmentFever is running rampant in DC.

Last week, the Left tried to impeach Justice Kavanaugh over a #FakeNews @nytimes article. 

Now they're tripping over themselves to impeach @realDonaldTrump.

Dems have zero credibility ‚Äì they'll impeach anybody they disagree with!
Folks should remember the big picture ‚Äìfake controversies like the Kavanaugh allegations and the nonexistent Ukrainian quid pro quo are nothing but a distraction.

The release of the DOJ IG #FISA abuse report is going to blow the lid off the efforts to undermine @realDonaldTrump.
"Whistleblower"? To something they haven‚Äôt witnessed first-hand?

More like a rogue, self-appointed private eye scooping up second-hand gossip and reading public news articles.

No quid pro quo, no crimes. @realDonaldTrump didn't break any laws.

The absurdity of this is almost unbelievable.

@SpeakerPelosi is *continuing* to press for impeachment over a transcript she hasn't read despite it being publicly available for hours.

As if it needed to be highlighted even more... the Left doesn't care about facts or the truth. https://t.co/BFz8tTYLz7
This is important.

The "favor" @realDonaldTrump is asking is for Ukraine's help in an ongoing law enforcement investigation by the Justice Department.

That's the President of the United States doing his duty. How else can the DOJ get foreign cooperation? https://t.co/9TAMwKzQcK
So this is their smoking gun?

The American public can read for the transcript for themselves. @HouseDemocrats' sole agenda is impeachment theater.

No quid pro quo, no pressure, no blackmail by @realDonaldTrump.

Started with the Squad, and now it‚Äôs a Mob. Under Democrats‚Äô lead, being innocent until proven guilty is gone.

The Left has whipped themselves into a frenzy based on zero evidence.

We cannot let their mob rule strip us of our Constitutional Republic‚Äôs most basic principles.
In their obsession to nullify the will of the people and overturn the results of the 2016 election, @HouseDemocrats and @SpeakerPelosi have become experts at hurling accusations before all the facts come out. 

My full statement on #impeachment ‚Üì https://t.co/uiN3lk953X
Truly remarkable that @SpeakerPelosi's "red line" on impeachment was a whistleblower complaint (the report on which nobody has seen) expressing secondhand concerns about a phone call between President Trump and a foreign leader (the transcript of which nobody has read). https://t.co/28xfD385kF
Yet again @realDonaldTrump shows an absolute willingness to comply with radical and baseless demands from unscrupulous Democrats.
