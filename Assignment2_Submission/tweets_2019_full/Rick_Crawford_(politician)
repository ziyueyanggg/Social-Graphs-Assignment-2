.@GOPLeader is asking questions that the entire American public deserve to know. If the Speaker continues to play games and display a continued lack of transparency, our country will suffer immensely. Halt the impeachment, Madam Speaker. https://t.co/xnQIptAgMM
@Ali_Conn Many - myself included - are concerned with this latest revelation of dishonesty by Schiff that this is a manufactured complaint/impeachment and that processes found in law should be followed. Many questions arise from all this that must be asked/investigated by HPSCI/SSCI.
As I mentioned in my interview over the weekend to @RobyBrock, #impeachment has been a constant topic since the first moments of @realDonaldTrump being sworn in as President. Don‚Äôt just take my word for it, here‚Äôs the evidence - from January 20th, 2017:

https://t.co/hd5JVy233K
@Athaxto The WB spoke to Democrat (Schiff)/Majority Staff. They did not speak to Republican (Nunes)/Minority Staff.
@Ali_Conn Nancy Pelosi by all accounts used this information to launch her impeachment proceedings before the transcript was released/made public. Since she entrusts Schiff with advising her on these issues, his dishonesty launched this latest chapter.
Adam Schiff lied to the press on this issue, kept it from other HPSCI members, and has only proven this entire event was started in an entirely dishonest manner. ‚ÄúExpressing regret‚Äù doesn‚Äôt begin to touch the damage he has caused this nation:

All the more reason why we must investigate the veracity of the claims made by the whistleblower. Afterall, we used to do this in a bipartisan fashion, until today #MakingSchiffUp https://t.co/EV29LDqkdv

This has all the hallmarks of the Russian Collusion Hoax, on repeat and with a different country. It would seem that Schiff and Company have now created the #UkraineHoax and will stop at nothing to further their unfounded, unpopular, impeachment inquiry. (end)
Shortly after the hearing ends, the New York Times publishes a story about who this whistleblower is and more about their alleged role in this entire ordeal:

https://t.co/aiJiWvDv8k
He &amp; others continually bully and berate Director Maguire in to casting judgement on the President, his actions and motives, while also continuously demanding that he protect the identity of the whistleblower. He continuously states he will and how he complied with all laws...
We learn a lot about the whistleblower from the report and at the HPSCI hearing, Schiff recklessly makes up a narrative of a mob boss shaking down someone, making it out to be what happened, when it was nothing but Impeachment Theater. In the hearing...
A hearing is scheduled with acting DNI Director Maguire to discuss the whistleblower and disseminating the claim to Congress, as required by law. This morning, the whistleblower report is released to the American people and its findings...
The contents of the call are made public and the American people can all see many media reports about the call were wrong. But, an impeachment inquiry is already afoot and the whistleblower report is about to be released. Impeachment is all anyone can talk about...
And, soon after that, the President pledges to make the contents of the call public. In the midst of all the media reports about withholding aid, and talking many, many times about Joe Biden, an unfounded impeachment inquiry is announced by Nancy Pelosi...
Soon, the emergence of the whistleblower complaint is reported - that we now know to be second-hand information, at best, and not directly involving the whistleblower. Meanwhile, the President begins to describe his call with the President of the Ukraine...
Around this same time, media reports start to build that the President is "withholding aid to the Ukraine". When coupled with Schiff's comments about investigating Joe Biden, a narrative begins to emerge. Then, more "reports" about the contents of the call emerge...
Here is where we stand after today's HPSCI hearing - a thread.  

In August, Schiff tweeted some of the allegations contained in the whistleblower complaint. That complaint addressed to Schiff was dated Aug 12th. His tweet? Aug 28th

https://t.co/E8FVmNW38e
Despite their best efforts, Schiff &amp; Co. failed to bully DNI Maguire into casting judgement against the President. He clearly &amp; continuously conveyed the thorough processing of the complaint in question. Now let‚Äôs get to the bottom of this matter &amp; the veracity of the allegations

Schiff‚Äôs opening statement ‚Äúparody‚Äù in today‚Äôs Maguire hearing was highly inappropriate and a gross abuse of his position as chairman of HPSCI - ill befitting this committee and this institution. Absolutely outrageous!
.@HouseDemocrats are so blinded by their hatred of @realDonaldTrump that they are ignoring all protocol. Whistleblowers should be protected, that's why it's so important for these hearings to be held privately like HPSCI typically does with these types of complaints.

I appreciate @realDonaldTrump  doing all he can to be transparent about the call with the President of Ukraine as well as this whistleblower complaint so the American people can see what was said and what is at stake. Joe Biden owes the American people the same courtesy
I have personally met with Acting Director McGuire previously and his record of service and dedication to our country is exemplary and honorable. I believe we will find his testimony to be nothing short of honest and as candid as possible in an open hearing
Speaker Pelosi along w/ Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler &amp; their cabal of liberal Democrats are weaponizing the IC, once again, against the President and this approach is further dividing our country &amp; pushing a deeply unpopular, unfounded impeachment inquiry against the President
ALL whistleblower complaints are taken seriously and fully investigated by this committee, and this should be handled no differently. Sadly, this has the hallmarks of the type of complaint that triggered the #RussiaHoax
HPSCI has always worked in a bipartisan way on whistleblower complaints, more than any other matter that comes before the committee. Today, that bipartisanship is being torn apart for political grandstanding &amp; impeachment theater
Today, HPSCI will have an unprecedented open hearing regarding a whistleblowing allegation levied against the President. While I regrettably am unable to be in Washington and attend this hearing, I wanted to share my views on this matter (1/x)
.@realDonaldTrump didn‚Äôt say he would w/ hold financial support if Ukraine didn‚Äôt investigate @JoeBiden, as reported. Biden‚Äôs name wasn‚Äôt mentioned 8 times, as reported. The only ‚Äútruth‚Äù is @HouseDemocrats are pursuing an unfounded impeachment inquiry. #ImpeachmentAboutNothing
