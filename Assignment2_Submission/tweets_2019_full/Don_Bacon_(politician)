@bfoxthinks @roseannmoring This is not strictly a NE01 issue and I’ll continue to work this. Red tape for permits is a taxpayer &amp; an infrastructure issue that impacts the entire state. STRATCOM impacts entire nation, and Offutt our local area. I’m glad to be a voice on this.

We built the Pentagon in 1 year &amp; the Golden Gate Bridge in 4 years, but it took 5 years to get a permit to raise the levees. This happens too often. If we want to fix our infrastructure, we must fix the broken permitting process.

Reality is there are no easy answers in Syria &amp; we only had 50 troops on the border. Our Kurdish allies fought with us for 16 years &amp; we can't abandon them. I support economic &amp; diplomatic means to sanction Turkey for its incursion, but we don’t want war.

The passage of #USMCA is long overdue. Nebraska is one of America's leading states for agriculture and this 21st century trade agreement will greatly benefit America's farmers and producers. We need to pass #USMCANow.

We cannot accept ISIS detainees escaping in NE Syria and returning to the battlefield to fight again. Turkey is solely responsible for the consequences of their reckless invasion and Congress will impose costs. We need to work with the Kurds to help secure these terrorists.

I will support legislation to sanction Turkey if they invade Syria and attack our Kurdish allies.
Our small military presence in Syria stabilizes the region, deters Iran, protects Israel, and prevents a repeat of the humanitarian disaster triggered by the previous administration’s policies.
While the President is right to demand that Europe do more to keep ISIS from regenerating, the Kurds have been our best armed allies in Iraq and Syria, and it would be wrong to abandon them now.
Thanks to Nebraska Firearms Owners Association for sharing their perspectives on the defense of the 2nd Amendment. It's important to provide bipartisan solutions that keep Americans safe. https://t.co/VJKrpHvbpq
