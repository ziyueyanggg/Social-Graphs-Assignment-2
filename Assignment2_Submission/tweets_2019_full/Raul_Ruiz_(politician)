25 years ago, #VAWA became law. Since then, it has framed our nation's response to the epidemics of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, &amp; stalking. The Senate must put politics aside, honor the legacy of #VAWA, and pass H.R. 1585 the VAWA Reauthorization! #VAWA25 https://t.co/1bVFUApT6k

üó£Ô∏è Gun violence is a public health crisis!

As an emergency medicine physician, I have seen the pain that this epidemic has inflicted. At today's Gun Violence Prevention Task Force hearing, I advocated for a public health approach that will put our children &amp; communities first. https://t.co/ziG82WejRk
As a physician, I‚Äôll always fight for the health of our communities by protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions, lowering prescription drug prices, and standing up for Medicare and Medicaid. No one should have to choose between seeing a doctor &amp; putting food on the table.
The administration's decision not to defend the ACA and consistent efforts to dismantle the progress we've made to improve the accessibility and affordability of quality health care is unacceptable.
I am deeply disappointed to learn that in 2018, the rate of uninsured Americans increased by nearly 2 million for the first time since 2014.
