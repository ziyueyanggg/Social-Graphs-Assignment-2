This week in Arizona, we celebrate Arizona Blood Donation Week, a week proclaimed by Gov. @dougducey  to help support Arizonans in need of blood donations. I encourage everyone able to donate blood for our neighbors in need to find out more about how you can help!
Every 3-4 weeks Adelyn relies on the generous donations of blood donors to keep her alive. She and her family were truly a pleasure to meet, and I thank them for sharing their strength and story with me.
Thank you @VitalantAZ for inviting me to tour your headquarters to learn more about blood storage and the importance of blood donations. During the visit, I met Adelyn who just received her 55th blood transfusion after being born with Diamond Blackfan Anemia. https://t.co/nEWCn3BLr7
