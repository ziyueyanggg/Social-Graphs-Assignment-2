@KeepinKidsSafe @iamwandasykes @iamjohnoliver @serenawilliams @MTV Yes! As mothers, we always want our children to have it better than we did. Sadly, when it comes to #maternalmortality, we‚Äôre failing. Rates have doubled since my children were born. The #MOMMAact will turn those numbers in the other direction.
Looks like spending $30+ million to elect President @realDonaldTrump got the #NRA a direct line to the Oval Office. People and lives should matter more than money. #AtWhatCost https://t.co/H2ov8txcTO
