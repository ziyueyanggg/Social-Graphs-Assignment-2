#MeToo is a movement, not a moment. In just 2 years, 15 states have passed laws to ban mandatory NDAs and forced arbitration, extend statutes of limitations, &amp; expand protections to more workers. State legislatures have intro'd 200+ bills. Let's keep the momentum going!

@AirResources To reach a fuel economy and air quality deal that balances our public health, economic, and environmental needs, we all need to work together. From the onset, the @CAgovernor has done that by being a good-faith negotiator and willing to compromise, but the federal govt has not.
