Sincere apologies.

Nothing worse in the history of our country than the brutal inhumanity of the horrible, relentless, and savage infliction of involuntary servitude-slavery- on millions of people whose freedom was denied. 

Nothing.
Never in the history of this country has it been legal to make people work for free but that’s what’s happening to federal employees. This can never happen again.
