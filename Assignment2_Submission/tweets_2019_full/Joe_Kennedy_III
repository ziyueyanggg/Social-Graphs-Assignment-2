As @realDonaldTrump &amp; @GOP blame mental health for gun violence once again, a helpful reminder that almost every GOP member &amp; senator voted to take mental health care away from millions of Americans. AND Trump’s Admin is in court right now to take it from millions more.
They will stop at nothing to divert your attention. It’s the video games. It’s the music. It’s the media. It’s the religion. It’s the schools. It’s them, it’s not us. It’s mental health but we’ll take your care anyways. Anything but the bullet in a child’s heart or mother’s head.
We are being broken by white male supremacy. And our President isn’t just ignoring this vicious terrorism. He’s giving it cover.
