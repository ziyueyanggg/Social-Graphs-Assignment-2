@POTUS …which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security., and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government’s support of Ukraine."
@POTUS Vindman said of @POTUS's July 25 call to PM Zelensky, "I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen," and "if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play ...
@POTUS “I stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push.”
@POTUS “Following this meeting, there was a scheduled debriefing during which Amb. Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma.”
@POTUS Of the July meeting w/Oleksandr Danylyuk, Bolton, Volker, Sondland &amp; Perry - Vindman said, “Amb. Sondland started to speak about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with the President, at which time Ambassador Bolton cut the meeting short."
@POTUS And, “While my interagency colleagues and I were becoming increasingly optimistic on Ukraine’s prospects, this alternative narrative undermined U.S. government efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine.”
@POTUS He noted that “In the Spring of 2019, I became aware of outside influencers promoting a false narrative of Ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views of the interagency. This narrative was harmful to U.S. government policy.”
@POTUS Vindman wrote, “I did convey certain concerns internally to National Security officials in accordance with my decades of experience and training, sense of duty, and obligation to operate within the chain of command,” noting that he reported his concerns twice as did Fiona Hill
Note: the reason why @POTUS is so desperate to attack a true soldier who has laid his life on the line for the defense of our country is because Vindman's testimony corroborates the testimony of other key witnesses and evidence of the President’s abuse of power &amp; obstruction.
@POTUS Let’s hear if for the true heroes who don’t tweet and pat themselves on the back at the end of every mission. They know that ISIS is wounded but not dead. They know the fight is far from over and remain vigilant.

This reauthorization bill, which @senatemajldr refuses to bring for a vote, builds on those critical reforms from 25 years ago and we cannot delay its passage any longer. #VAWA4ALL #VAWA25 https://t.co/VhJXOAbTHH
I know that @chelliepingree and our colleagues in the @HouseDemWomen Caucus and @HouseDemocrats will not rest until #VAWA is reauthorized and finally extends protections to #Maine tribes! https://t.co/LLkIddwDFk
@senatemajldr Senate Republicans and @senatemajldr are more beholden to the deep pockets of the NRA than to survivors across the country, relenting to NRA lobbying AGAINST the landmark Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act! On the 25th anniversary of VAWA we must act &amp; pass HR1585 NOW!
@senatemajldr Over 1/2 of the mass shootings in the US involve intimate partner or family violence. The majority of these kinds of killers have a history of domestic violence. Women here are 21X more likely to be killed w/a gun than women in other high-income countries. We need #VAWA!
@senatemajldr For 25 years, VAWA has led our nation's response to the epidemics of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. How deeply shameful that @senatemajldr and Senate Republicans have let VAWA expire! We must stand up for #VAWA4ALL by passing HR1585! #VAWA25
More than 3 women are murdered by their partners EVERY DAY in the U.S. #VAWA19 will save lives. Senate Republicans and @senatemajldr must stand with women and pass H.R. 1585 NOW! Survivors deserve nothing less. #VAWA4ALL
For 25 years VAWA has kept women alive &amp; made our communities safer. It's trained law enforcement, strengthened our legal systems, and been a lifeline for survivors. It's time to put politics aside and honor the legacy of #VAWA25 by passing HR1585 the VAWA Reauthorization! https://t.co/FWRS2sD7Og

Intro'ed a resolution w/@DebDingell &amp; @RepGwenMoore recognizing the intersection between #misogyny, violence against women &amp; #gunviolence in honor of tomorrow's 25th anniversary of #VAWA. Congress must reauthorize VAWA &amp; recognize this inextricable link! https://t.co/3Yv3nugezr

Of all the horrific cases read at the Special Order Hour on forced arbitration, the account of an 87-yr-old nun brutally raped at a nursing home &amp; told by the company's arbitrator she didn't seem upset enough for her claim to be true makes my blood boil. https://t.co/QKEXolNUN6
I was proud to organize the @HouseDemWomen Special Order Hour on the dangers of forced arbitration for women workers. The 60+ million subjected to it have a greater chance of being struck by lightening than winning their case. Congress - pass the FAIR Act! https://t.co/2hIwpQFp4N
#MeToo showed we are not alone. We have strength in numbers.

On the 18th anniversary of #September11th we remember the horror of that day, the tragedy of those we lost &amp; the debt still owed to our first responders. We must also consider the lessons learned and what is best for our country, and all Americans, as we move forward. https://t.co/L5q42y5SXR
The testimony @HouseGVP heard today was a poignant counterpoint to @senatemajldr's utter betrayal of the people. As our witnesses said, when we were faced w/too many deadly car accidents, we took evidence-based steps to save lives. No excuse for not doing the same w/gun violence! https://t.co/r8StQ9GivY

Annexation is not an option. Proceeding would be a boon for BDS, cripple 2 states &amp; hamper those of us who believe in a Jewish, democratic Israel. Israel needs secure borders but they must come from negotiations. Bibi &amp; @POTUS, stop risking Israel’s security for political gain!
