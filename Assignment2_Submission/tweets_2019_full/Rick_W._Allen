Chairman Scott not only wouldn’t support my amendment, he used this opportunity to rail against the tax cuts passed last Congress that have benefited hard-working Americans.

I spoke on the House floor in strong opposition to Speaker Pelosi &amp; House Dems' impeachment inquiry. If they truly believe that this is the right thing to do, why won’t they hold a vote? The Democrats’ complete disregard for following a fair process is alarming and un-American. https://t.co/bahdDyietI
Rep. Allen is still down there, and will not leave the SCIF until there are answers. While House Democrat leadership continues to withhold information and pursue a closed-door process, Rep. Allen will not stop fighting until this impeachment sham is over. 3/3
To no one’s surprise, Mr. Schiff then left the room, continuing this secretive process so he can cherry-pick what information to leak. All members deserve to get the facts – and so do the American people.  2/3
Update from my staff on the #StoptheSchiffShow: This morning, Congressman Allen and several GOP members stormed the impeachment hearing room and successfully got in. 1/3
Not only will Speaker Pelosi &amp; Dems not hold a vote on the impeachment inquiry, they won’t let us vote on a resolution that has 170+ cosponsors, H.Res. 630. Mr. Schiff has used his position to mislead the American people. Unfortunately Dems won’t allow for any accountability.

The #DoNothingDemocrats' agenda to undermine President Trump is costing the American people. It’s time for Congress to focus on passing #USMCA, securing the border, and lowering prescription drug prices. https://t.co/hNr8jVVrTj
Don’t let Democrats’ impeachment inquiry distract you from today’s economic news – U.S. unemployment hit a 50-year low and 136,000 jobs were added during September. Dems should focus on pro-growth policies so we can keep the good news coming! #JobsReport https://t.co/IHZFrVIsNs

@POTUS Medicare-for-All would create a single-payer system run by the federal government for everyone. President Trump’s Executive Order will ensure our seniors have choices and access to quality, affordable care.

Democrats' agenda to undermine President Trump comes at a cost to the American people—ignoring the pressing issues at hand. One of the best examples is Congress’ lack of action to tackle the crisis at our border. But once again, Democrats continue to put forward partisan bills. https://t.co/LhcaW0SVuU
I urge my Democratic colleagues to stop grasping for straws, end this partisan impeachment process, and instead start focusing on delivering results for the American people. 3/3
It’s unfortunate that Speaker Pelosi has caved to the far left-wing faction of their conference, despite President Trump offering full transparency. 2/3
Since the day President Trump was elected to office, Democrats have tried to find any opportunity to undermine his presidency. In this most recent attempt, they made accusations before any facts were presented. 1/3
