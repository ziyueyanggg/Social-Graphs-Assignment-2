#12 Finally, the “Impeach Now” argument fallacy is exposed by a hypothetical. Assume an American engages in foreign corruption. His “get out of jail free” pass is simple: run for public office &amp; be untouchable. That is absurd. Yet that is the Socialist &amp; Fake News Media argument.
#11 There is more. The “contribution” of a “thing” must be “in connection with” a campaign.  What campaign? Trump &amp; Joe Biden are NOT adversarial candidates in a campaign RIGHT NOW.  A YEAR FROM NOW Trump will campaign against the Socialist Dems’ nominee (likely NOT Joe Biden).
#10 Take the Socialist Dems and Fake News Media’s argument to its logical end, that a President can NEVER acquesce to an investigation of criminal acts by ANY candidate because that MIGHT affect a candidate’s election. That is absurd. No law means that. Yet so they argue.
#9 It is the duty of ALL presidents to ferret out corruption in America, or by Americans abroad, particularly when an American Vice-President boasts on video that he used $1 billion in taxpayer money to coerce Ukraine to stop an investigation that happens to involve the VP’s son!
#8 Well, then, how about a non-physical thing (if there is such a “thing”)? Is letting a foreign government know it is ok to resume its investigation of alleged Biden Family corruption - that may extend all the way to the Obama White House - a campaign “thing”? ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!
#7 What “other THING of value” did Trump “solicit” for a “federal campaign”? Yard signs? No. Door-to-door volunteers? No. Phone banking? No. Billboards? No. TV, radio or internet ads? No. Think about it. Trump didn’t solicit a single PHYSICAL campaign “thing” of ANY kind.
#6 Socialists &amp; Fake News Media claim Trump violated (a)(2) by “soliciting” a “contribution or donation” as defined in (a)(1)(A).  A “contribution or donation” of what? “Of money or other thing of value”. Trump “solicited” no “cash”. So focus on “other thing of value”.

#5 More: “The world has warmed at less than half the originally-predicted rate, and at less than half the rate to be expected on the basis of net anthropogenic forcing and radiative imbalance. It tells us that we are far from understanding climate change.” GREAT POINT! Mo
#4 More:“The geological archive reveals that Earth’s climate has varied as long as the planet has existed, with natural cold and warm phases. The Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850. Therefore, it is no surprise that we now are experiencing a period of warming.” I CONCUR! Mo
#3 More letter content: “We urge you to follow a climate policy based on sound science, realistic economics and genuine concern for those harmed by costly but unnecessary attempts at mitigation.” I CONCUR! Mo
