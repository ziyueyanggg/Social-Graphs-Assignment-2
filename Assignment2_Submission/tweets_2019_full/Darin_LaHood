The American people didn't send us to Washington to rewrite the results of the 2016 election. They sent us to Washington to solve problems, and it‚Äôs unfortunate that Democrats continue to put politics over progress and results.
Instead of working together to pass USMCA or lower drug costs, Dems decided to placate to their extreme base by wasting more taxpayer dollars on an impeachment inquiry. The Dems also compromised an important European ally in Ukraine and potentially harmed our national security.
Impeachment should only be used with extreme caution and rooted in evidence and facts. Impeachment is divisive and nullifies the will of the American people. It is disappointing that so many Dems jumped to conclusions before reading the full transcript.
