Introduced H.Res. 486 to honor the life of NBA legend, John Havlicek, one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history. He was born in Martins Ferry and was a three-sport All-State athlete at Bridgeport HS. As an All-American at @OhioState , he helped the team win the 1960 title.
House voted to continue supporting the heroes who selflessly+willingly ran toward danger-while others were fleeing the horror-on 9/11/01. We passed #HR1327 which I co-sponsored, to permanently authorize the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. Simply the right thing to do.
For nearly six decades, Congress has put aside politics and advanced a bipartisan defense bill, with support from both parties.  Not this year, at least in the House. #NDAA   https://t.co/lNF7yGPShE

On with @TomRoten at the top of the hour.  @800_WVHU   - talking citizenship question and drug pricing transparency
It is simply ridiculous for our country - or any other country - to prohibit itself from asking those living within its borders whether or not they are legal citizens. https://t.co/geXdS2NKNg

Eastern and Southeastern Ohio is fortunate to have many good, local papers. This is a sad reminder that we need to support them. In a lot of our communities, they are the main source of information. 2/2
Saddened to learn that the Youngstown @vindicator is shutting down operations after 150 years. Although I have not always agreed with some of the positions taken and reported by the paper, The Vindicator leaves behind a great legacy and a proud tradition. 1/2

The bottom line here is that it is the height of stupidity for our country, or any other country for that matter, to prohibit itself from simply asking those living within its borders, whether or not they are legal citizens. https://t.co/ArQTVj2QQB #Census #SCOTUS

On tomorrow AM with @TomRoten on @800_WVHU at 7:35 AM. Will talk border issues and Iran. Listen @iHeartRadio
It’s time #Iran starts acting like a peaceful and constructive member of the global community of nations. President Obama is gone, and no one is going to send them pallets of cash now to reward them for their dangerous and destructive behavior.
Big crowd this weekend as a restored Mirror Lake was dedicated and the memorial pillars were unveiled at Firestone Park in Columbiana. A lot of hard work from community members went into this. https://t.co/N0G5drRuDP

The Supreme Court ruled this morning that there is nothing unconstitutional about the Bladensburg #PeaceCross in Maryland; It has stood for over 90 years to honor those we lost in World War I. This clearly is a victory for religious freedom.
