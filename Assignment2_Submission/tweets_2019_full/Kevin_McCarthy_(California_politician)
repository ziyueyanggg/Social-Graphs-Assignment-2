Democrats used their backwards "guilty until proven innocent" system of justice for the Mueller report, then against Kavanaugh, and now they admit they're using it again‚Äîthis time to impeach the duly-elected president.
 
That is NOT the American way. https://t.co/4TLpjreaWm
Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Schiff just doubled down on their plan to sneak impeachment past the American people:
‚áí Behind closed doors
‚áí Without due process
‚áí Without a single vote
 
This is a total sham.
