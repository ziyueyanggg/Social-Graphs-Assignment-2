America is facing a crisis in confidence. Obama's decision to cancel a strike in Syria in 2013 has had ramifications that are still being felt today. We cannot let the provocations and attacks by Iran go unanswered. https://t.co/AAFfnaqtZ5
The US can easily act with a proportional response-and should-while simultaneously sending the message to Iran that any further provocation will be met with a far more significant reaction.
Talia* is one of more than 500,000 Syrian children living in the @Refugees settlements in Lebanon. As we recognize #WorldRefugeeDay today, may we be inspired by children like Talia* who continue to smile, with strength and resilience, in hopes of a brighter tomorrow. https://t.co/rtxbOqbjdG
This attack on America over international airspace is a bridge too far and another miscalculated escalation by Iran. Desperate and weakened, the Iranian regime is playing a very dangerous game. May God be with our military.
