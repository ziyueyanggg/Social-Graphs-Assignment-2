Next, Congress should pass the Fix the Immigration Loopholes Act  ‚Äî which I have co-sponsored ‚Äî  to build on this effort and address the crisis at our southern border.
Addressing the decades-old Flores agreement is a pivotal step to restoring integrity to our asylum process, combatting the rampant rise of human trafficking, and ensuring that bad actors do not impede the immigration process for credible asylum seekers.
That is not lawful immigration, but manipulation of our system at the expense of innocent minors for a profit.
This incentivized smugglers and human traffickers to fraudulently present themselves as families by exploiting migrant children, to which they had no relation, and using them as pawns in family asylum claims.
Until now, the Flores Settlement Agreement required that family unit aliens be released after 20 days.
@DHSMcAleenan @SecAzar By issuing the Flores final rule, border security personnel will be able to keep families together through the duration of their immigration proceedings while maintaining humanitarian care and housing standards.
.@DHSMcAleenan and @SecAzar took appropriate action to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement, a fundamental flaw in our immigration system that has been exploited by bad actors and fueled our immigration crisis.
