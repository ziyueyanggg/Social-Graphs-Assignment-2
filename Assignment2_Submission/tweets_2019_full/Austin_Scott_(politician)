Another issue (1 of many) I have with the Dems‚Äô support of the ACA is the lie they spread that you can sign-up for insurance whenever you have the need. That is blatantly false. Individuals can only sign-up during open enrollment which only runs for a couple of weeks each yr.
One big change I've advocated for is to bring health insurers under the umbrella of US anti-trust laws. How can we expect lower premiums if these companies are exempt from anti-trust laws (which are in place for good reason &amp; cover virtually every other industry in our country)?
I got a little heated this week when my Democratic colleagues suggested that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is good as-is and doesn't need any major changes to better help the American people. That couldn't be further from the truth, and they know it.
Yesterday, I signed the discharge petition to bring the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act to the House floor for consideration. For a month, Democratic leadership has ignored unanimous consent requests to vote on this bill. #LetUsVote #EndInfanticide
