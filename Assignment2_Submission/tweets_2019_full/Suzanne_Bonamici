The Dignity in Aging Act provides meaningful increases in funding for all OAA programs, which will help expand access to food assistance &amp; other basic services that help seniors live independently and with dignity. It also supports caregivers, combats social isolation, &amp; more.

I have heard too many stories about seniors rationing medication or saving portions of their meals so that they can stretch their resources a bit further.
The Older Americans Act serves about 11 million individuals each year through social services and community-based programs. More people are living longer, but funding has not kept up with increasing need for services.
Today the House passed my bipartisan update, the Dignity in Aging Act of 2019, to provide seniors and their caregivers with desperately needed resources and expanded services.
More than 50 years ago, Congress passed the Older Americans Act so seniors can live with dignity. The OAA includes important programs like Meals on Wheels, community meal programs, caregiver support, and elder abuse prevention. https://t.co/vYCHTdVrLT

H.R. 3 will help lower out-of-pocket expenses, particularly for seniors because it will have Medicare negotiate for lower prices.
I've also dealt with out-of-pocket costs of about $300 a month for just one of my mother’s medications. She’s a 91-year-old cancer survivor with Alzheimer's. We were able to cover that cost, but what about families who can’t afford the cost of lifesaving medication?
The list price for that drug was more than $250, and he was responsible for a 20% copay. Jon is fortunate because he has insurance, and he was not forced to choose between life-saving medication and putting food on the table. Too many Americans are not so lucky.
I recently held six town hall meetings in five counties across Northwest Oregon—and the issue of unaffordable drug prices came up at every single one of them. In Cornelius, a gentleman named Jon held up a small tube of medication and shared his experience.

It’s been four years since the tragic shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. Students often tell me they worry about their safety at school, and that breaks my heart. We must do more to keep young people-- and everyone in our communities-- safe from gun violence.
Looking forward to starting my fall town hall series in Cornelius tomorrow! This meeting will be bilingual with Spanish interpretation.

The House will fully investigate the whistleblower complaint about President Trump asking Ukraine for a “favor.” Whistleblowers are a vital check on abuse and wrongdoing, and the law rightly protects their anonymity. #ExposeTheTruth https://t.co/iXNe5sGOZa
Two years ago in Las Vegas, a killer took the lives of 58 people and scores more were injured. Gun violence leads to dozens of lives lost every day. The House passed background checks months ago, but Senator McConnell refuses to allow a vote. #1October

I’m supporting the EACH Woman Act because no one should be denied health care because of the kind of insurance they have, where they live, or how much money they have. #BeBoldEndHyde
The first woman to lose her life because of Hyde was Rosie Jimenez, in Texas. Had she not died from an illegal abortion, she would be 69 years old. Here is her story. #BeBoldEndHyde

The science in this report is clear. Our ocean is becoming more acidic, warming, &amp; losing oxygen as a direct result of anthropogenic emissions. Glaciers that once covered mountain tops across the West are rapidly melting. Sea-ice free summers are becoming the norm in the Arctic.
Today the @IPCC_CH released a Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate. The findings are dire. The #ClimateCrisis is causing devastating effects, from the remote deep ocean floor to the most pristine Arctic &amp; mountain regions

I am committed to working with the Speaker and my colleagues to advance an impeachment inquiry that will protect the American people and our national security. https://t.co/HRv3DyQwbF
Families, individuals, and communities across the U.S. need to have faith in their elections and deserve a president who has their best interest in mind, not someone who has repeatedly taken advantage of the Executive Office for personal gain.
Asking a foreign country to meddle in an upcoming election is a serious national security concern.
The President admitted to asking a foreign government to investigate a political adversary. He must be held accountable for this impeachable offense, along with his many other wrongdoings that have betrayed the trust of the American people and undermined our democracy.

Additionally, these programs allow employers to align quality on-the-job training with their local needs. As our global economy continues to evolve, we need to make significant investments in federal workforce development programs to prepare workers for in-demand industries.
Workforce development programs provide pathways for workers to better-paying jobs &amp; economic security. These programs provide critical support to women, people of color, dislocated workers, disconnected youth, people with disabilities &amp; others who may face barriers to employment.

Time for Congress to get the whistleblower’s complaint (as required by law) and ramp up an impeachment investigation to hold Trump accountable for this and other wrongdoings.
Pres. Trump admitted he spoke w/ the Ukrainian president about Joe Biden, a political rival. Outrageous. If there’s nothing to hide, Trump should release the transcript. I predict he won’t, however, because he continues to put himself &amp; his campaign before the good of the country

I urge the Senate to swiftly pass this bill so Americans have full access to their legal rights.
Today the House took an important step to protect consumers by passing the #FAIRAct, which will abolish mandatory forced arbitration provisions in contracts involving consumer, employment, antitrust, and civil rights disputes.
Individuals deserve their day in court, and forced arbitration clauses deny them access to justice.
Workers, consumers, and families have been bound by unfair forced arbitration agreements for too long. Arbitration clauses are unjust when there is disparity in bargaining power between the parties. https://t.co/ph3vT2KWU9 #EndForcedArbitration

The Department of Education must uphold its end of the deal it made with borrowers who are serving our communities as teachers, health care providers, firefighters, and in the military.
Only one of the borrowers present at my event had her loans forgiven under the TEPSLF program, making her one of the 1 percent of borrowers nationwide to benefit from the program and one of only 24 borrowers in Oregon to receive relief as of the latest data. Unacceptable.
They told me about putting off marriages, home ownership, and starting families because of the burden of their student loan debt. They also spoke about their passion for public service, and how much they love the work they do.
At today's @EdLaborCmte hearing, I shared powerful stories from Oregonians who dedicated their careers to public service and planned their futures around the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. But for almost all of them the PSLF has been an empty promise. https://t.co/NT6dwtoEfq
