Since LITERALLY DAY 1, Democrats have been trying to impeach @realDonaldTrump. 

They didn't have a legitimate reason then, and they don't have a legitimate reason now.

It's long past time for Democrats and the liberal media to give up their baseless impeachment witch hunt. https://t.co/gtTYO7xEwV

The fix is in. This impeachment scheme is all about politics for Democrats. They're trying to rig 2020 against @realDonaldTrump. Take their word for it:

"What's more serious is that he can't win" -Nancy Pelosi

"If we don't impeach...he will get re-elected" -Rep Al Green https://t.co/XY1CyY4UCv

Democrats are making a mockery of Congress.

Adam Schiff is a proven partisan with a history of making false allegations in pursuit of his political agenda to impeach @realDonaldTrump &amp; undo the 2016 election.

The way he runs the Intel Committee is an outrageous abuse of power.
üö®üö® This is looking more &amp; more like a deep state scheme.

Schiff knew about the whistleblower complaint before it was filed &amp; his team advised the whistleblower on how to proceed.

He's running the same playbook against @realDonaldTrump that Senate Dems ran against Kavanaugh. https://t.co/CAbaJYTjU9

Democrats in Washington are so obsessed with their pointless impeachment scheme that they're prioritizing it over the ratification of #USMCA.

Their delays are costing American workers and farmers new jobs, higher wages, and a stronger economy. https://t.co/kQ51U0QKXD
Democrats have been throwing out baseless accusations against @realDonaldTrump since before he was even elected‚Äîand they‚Äôve all turned out to be wrong. 

There has to be a level of responsibility. These reckless Democrat schemes are beyond madness at this point. https://t.co/4xYyLucCbz
Radicals &amp; socialists have taken over the Democrat Party. They're calling all the shots now.

Just last week, they pressured Pelosi into launching a baseless impeachment inquiry based on false rumors &amp; left-wing rage.

This is a witch hunt of @realDonaldTrump, plain &amp; simple. https://t.co/60btf1wNyy

Pelosi said there'd be reasons to impeach @realDonaldTrump BEFORE she had the facts. She was wrong.

Here's the bottom line: No high crimes &amp; misdemeanors. Time to MOVE ON!

We should be focused on:
- Passing #USMCA
- Solving the border crisis
- Lowering prescription drug prices https://t.co/joDMCuY9Pw
I won't let the media get away with reciting Democrat talking points.

The fact is Pelosi broke precedent &amp; started this baseless impeachment inquiry without a vote.

Why? She wanted to shield her members from going on record that they support this witch hunt of @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/TCIJSsFfKS
Let me get this straight: Adam Schiff‚Äîthe man who falsely claimed there was more than circumstantial evidence of collusion‚Äîis now trying to convince the American people that there were high crimes &amp; misdemeanors, despite the fact that the transcript shows none?

Give me a break. https://t.co/hvrUXkseoB
