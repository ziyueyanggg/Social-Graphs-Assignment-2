Because the VA has consistently failed to enact policies that meet our federal trust responsibility, I have introduced the bipartisan Native American Veteran PACT Act to force their hand by prohibiting the VA from charging AI/AN vets copays for care. https://t.co/0glgfxTph1
The @VetAffairsDems Subcommittee on Health is examining barriers that Native American vets face seeking access to quality care.

A bill I intro'd yesterday would end the practice of charging Native American vets copayments for care at the VA.

I look forward to continuing the work of Congress and the Armed Services Committee to provide the resources and authorities to ensure that ISIS troops allowed to escape as a result of Trump‚Äôs actions do not result in a rapid replacement of al-Baghdadi atop a resurgent ISIS.
I fear that Trump‚Äôs actions may make this kind of cooperation and coordination more difficult in the future, and render our national security more vulnerable as a result.
It appears this &amp; other operations in recent days have been enabled by our Kurdish ‚Äì not Turkish ‚Äì allies. The Syrian Democratic Forces have maintained their honor &amp; courage even after President Trump‚Äôs betrayal.
I share the concerns of Speaker Pelosi &amp; HASC Chairman Smith that Russian sources were made aware of this operation before Congressional leadership. This White House has a pattern of prioritizing Russian interests over American ones that must not be allowed to continue.
The death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is a blow to ISIS, and the world is a safer place without him. I am thankful for the service members who go into harm‚Äôs way to undertake missions like these.

Despite our progress, there is much to be done. On this #IndigenousPeoplesDay, I pledge to keep fighting for Native vets &amp; an end to the MMIW crisis, to continue to champion prosperity in Indian Country, &amp; above all, to always stand up for the Indigenous peoples of this land.
We held hearings on education and infrastructure in Indian Country to promote economic development, uncover the unmet needs and abuses that currently exist, and to hold administration officials accountable to our promises to tribes. https://t.co/VCugkbh7Dq
We are moving forward with efforts to ensure advance appropriations for Indian Country so Indigenous communities NEVER bear the devastating brunt of a shutdown in Washington ever again.
We have prioritized protecting sacred sites and places Indigenous communities have inhabited for millennia - from Chaco Canyon to Bears Ears to the Grand Canyon - from drilling and exploitation.
We‚Äôve also championed the RESPECT Act, which would codify the government‚Äôs responsibility to conduct govt-to-govt consultation with tribes on policies impacting them.
We passed a clean Carcieri fix, a bill reaffirming tribal sovereignty and ensuring the ability of tribal communities to have a homeland.
Earlier this year, we held the first-ever House hearing on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women to hear from Native women themselves, and last month we held a follow up #MMIW hearing to hold this administration accountable for implementing solutions. https://t.co/jQJNXXD3uQ
That‚Äôs why, as Chairman of the Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples, I have made it the subcommittee‚Äôs priority to lift up Native voices and advocate for a renewed commitment to honoring our trust responsibilities to Native communities:
On #IndigenousPeoplesDay we celebrate the communities who were here before us, honor their cultures, and remember their histories - which also means remembering the legacy of oppression Native Americans experienced at the hands of the federal government.

Unfortunately, I have little hope that those steps will be taken by this White House. So I look forward to the day when a new President takes them.
Moving fwd I urge the WH to staff the State Dept w apolitical professionals to rebuild our allied response to this crisis. I urge them to direct Treasury to enforce sanctions on Chinese enablers of Kim Jong Un. I urge them to focus on the danger this situation poses to the nation
Had the President not isolated us by insulting our allies, we could work closely with them to reduce the danger posed by dictators like Kim Jong Un.
If the President were not corrupt, we could be confident in his ability to use our economic power to punish North Korea in response to this development.
Iran is empowered by his pulling out of the JCPOA for no reason. Russia is emboldened by his failure to take their meddling in our election seriously. China is bullying its way around Asia. North Korea is not only a nuclear power, but is also growing its arsenal‚Äôs size and reach.

TL/DR: Going to war with Iran is illegal. Going to war with Iran for Saudi Arabia is incredibly stupid. We need to strengthen ourselves for competition with China and outlasting Russia. This is in the American interest. A Trumpy war with Iran isn‚Äôt. (7/7)
We can (and should) fight Iran in other ways. Sanction the hell out of them again. Pressure Europe to do the same. Enforce freedom of navigation in Hormuz. Use the intel community to leverage all of the above. All cheaper and more effective than war. (6/)
Add this situation into the larger world context. We have a military that‚Äôs worn down from 2 decades of war, a Russia that caught us by surprise and a China that has grown into a behemoth. We need to hustle to meet those threats now. (5/)
A war with Iran would be brutal. Americans would die, probably in large numbers. Iran could strike back anywhere, in Syria, Iraq, against Israel, or in Europe. War would be hard to contain (4/)
BUT fighting Saudi‚Äôs war for them is the WORST possible thing we could do. Why take over their war against Iran? Sec. Mattis used to say that Saudi Arabia will fight Iran to the last American. We can‚Äôt let them do that. (3/)
The Houthis do get arms &amp; support from Iran. They aren‚Äôt capable of ballistic missile and drone attacks by themselves. (2/)
Going to war with Iran on Saudi Arabia‚Äôs behalf would be both illegal and stupid. Here‚Äôs why. (1/)

I'm hopeful the final NDAA passed by Congress later this year will include my provision to stop Trump from using our armed services as a bottomless piggy bank to execute his worst-laid political plans. We must put an end to Trump's attempts to usurp Congressional spending power.
This administration's abuse of power and overreach have reached a new low. Redirecting military funds for the wall violates bipartisan congressional intent, it violates the Constitution, and it violates our nation's fundamental values.
Trump is jeopardizing our military readiness &amp; national security by stealing money from our troops for a useless border wall that Congress resoundingly denied.
