The people of El Paso are kindhearted, patriotic and resilient. 

We spent time with several community members this week.

Pray for them.

Support the response effort.

And then demand that Congress act to end the carnage in America.
Back home after visiting asylum seekers on the border. 

Trump’s new Wait-in-Mexico protocol is another nasty &amp; xenophobic scheme. 

Asylum seekers are entitled to due process here.
