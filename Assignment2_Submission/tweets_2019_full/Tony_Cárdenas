Today, I join @HouseDemocrats in supporting a historic bill to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and defend its great habitats and wildlife. #ProtectTheArctic

18 years ago, 2,974 innocent Americans lost their lives in a terrorist attack. But the resilience of America was demonstrated following these attacks when we came together and rebuilt. We showed that the will &amp; strength of the American spirit can overcome anything. #NeverForget
It is important that we understand the severity of the situation. The people of Kashmir need access to clean water, food, and access to information and school.

The dispute over Kashmir will only be solved when India, Pakistan, and the leadership of Kashmir come to the table.
I applaud the House Foreign Affairs Committee‚Äôs Subcommittee on Asia for holding a hearing on the humanitarian and human rights situation in the Kashmir Valley. Reports of the situation in Kashmir are concerning.
Mental health is just as important as physical health. To me, there is no distinction. On this #WorldSuicidePreventionDay, let us commit to ending the stigma around mental health.

Reach out to your friends &amp; family &amp; check in with them.  No one should have to suffer in silence.
Bolton‚Äôs replacement must be someone who understands the importance of our global alliances, respects Congress‚Äô authority, and will always put America‚Äôs security above personal and political interests.
A war hawk like John Bolton should not have been in the White House to begin with. I am relieved that he is no longer working for the President, however, I am deeply concerned about the chaos of this administration.
The overwhelming majority of Americans agree that we must pass commonsense gun-safety legislation. The House sent @senatemajldr bipartisan #HR8 nearly 200 days ago, yet, he refuses to bring it to a vote. Why won't McConnell #DoSomething to #EndGunViolence?
This is wrong. We shouldn't be turning away families and children fleeing war and violence. We should embrace those who knock on our doors and show love and compassion.

We honor them with real solutions and progress on gun safety not empty words. The House sent @senatemajldr bipartisan background check legislation but he refuses to bring them to a vote. @realDonaldTrump, if you really want honor them, you should support the House-led bills. https://t.co/M5jY2wRgji
Taking funding away from military schools and daycare to fund an ineffective and costly border wall is bad policy. This vanity project only proves that President Trump does not care about military families and that he is not fit to lead this country.

Hundreds of thousands of talented #Dreamers have benefited from #DACA, but the Trump has left the future of the program unclear. Right now, you can still apply to renew your #DACA if you meet the requirements for renewal. ‚Üí https://t.co/ijP1ntcWdM https://t.co/8B4cAybXRn
This is moronic. President Trump is planning on defunding military construction projects to pay for a useless and expensive border wall. Undermining our national security for a vanity project is not good leadership.

Five years ago, @CVSHealth ended the sale of tobacco products at its stores. This is the kind of leadership we need from the private sector -- putting people over profits. #TobaccoFree
On this #LaborDay,  we celebrate working families who are the foundation of this country. From equal pay to raising the minimum wage, Democrats will continue fighting #ForThePeople. Wishing everyone a safe and fun day!
Just as an fyi for anyone asking why the Congress isn‚Äôt getting anything done on gun safety ‚Äî the House passed background check legislation and Mitch McConnell refuses to bring them to a vote. #EnoughIsEnough
Praying for the victims of the shooting in Texas. This has to stop.
56 years ago today, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led the March on Washington where he delivered his ‚ÄúI  Have a Dream‚Äù speech. As I reflect on the words of Dr. King, I‚Äôm reminded that we still have work to do.
‚ÄúThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.‚Äù https://t.co/sBBx3S5fP1
This is how @realDonaldTrump treats our service members who are sacrificing so much to keep us safe.  Disgraceful.

@realDonaldTrump, this is a bad idea -- even for you. https://t.co/QMK5h4L6FS
For this and many other reasons, I've called for an impeachment inquiry into President Trump. He has no respect for the rule of law or democratic values.
A lawless president.

Following a devastating IG report on veteran suicide, I'm joining @VetAffairsDems Chair.@RepMarkTakano in calling for a stand-down. Here‚Äôs what that means:
üá∫üá∏ Ensure all VA staff are fully trained
üá∫üá∏ Assess facility infrastructure
üá∫üá∏ Identify gaps in policies/procedures/resources
Yesterday, I was recognized by the @VFWHQ for my work with veterans and making sure that the VFW has the resources they need to keep providing essential services to our military members and their families. I will always have the backs of the brave men and women in uniform. https://t.co/s8gGsNje8X
The House of Representative is living up to that promise ‚Äî from passing the Paycheck Fairness Act to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Now it is time for Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans to do the same.
We must deliver on the promise of America that everyone is endowed with the inalienable rights of liberty and equality enshrined in our Constitution.
Today, women are still not compensated fairly making only 80 cents to every dollar her male counterpart earns. The pay gap is even wider for Latina women, who earn 53 cents to every dollar.
Let us honor the brave women who gave their lives in the struggle for equality and the sacrifices they made with more than empty words, but with real progress.
Today, we celebrate the 99th anniversary since women won the right to vote. On this Women‚Äôs Equality Day, I reflect on the strides we‚Äôve made as a nation in the fight for equality and justice, but I am reminded that there is still so much more that we need to do.
RT @Jon_Huertas: From my own experience, this rings true. This study speaks to the film industry but Television also has a lack of Latinx D‚Ä¶RT @From my own experience, this rings true. This study speaks to the film industry but Television also has a lack of Latinx Directors, Show Runners, Lead characters as well as Studio &amp; Network Executives. We as Latinx creatives have a responsibility to change this! #LatINclusion https://t.co/ADpYzuYQqU
Trump‚Äôs reckless trade war w/ China is hurting businesses, farmers, and workers in the San Fernando Valley and across America. He might not realize this or he simply doesn't care, but his irresponsible trade policies are squeezing American manufacturers.

Today, I sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security to inquire about the concerning increase in rabbit testing and the extent of the department‚Äôs animal research.

On Friday, I had the opportunity to tour the San Fernando Community Health Center, the very place where I was born, and speak w/ experts about improving our healthcare system &amp; increasing access to affordable, quality health coverage. TY to the dedicated staff for all you do! https://t.co/yFIDLzxaUV
The American people are the biggest losers in Trump‚Äôs trade war. He is killing the American dream.
Trump‚Äôs tariffs are preventing Valley businesses from growing and are stopping them from hiring, ultimately making it harder to compete with China. This is hurting the economy in Southern California and across the United States.
I‚Äôve spent the last few weeks talking to American manufacturers and business owners in the San Fernando Valley and one thing is clear: we are all paying the price for Trump‚Äôs irresponsible trade policies.
Trump‚Äôs reckless trade war with China is hurting American businesses, farmers, and workers.
One of my constituents who helped organize this meeting w/ Mr. Olson and Mr. Calderon sent me this beautiful card in the mail. I'm so proud of the work my team does to help veterans in my district. I will never stop fighting for our veterans and I will always have their backs. https://t.co/Q9zelxhpR6
Last week, I held an immigration roundtable with activists, non-profit leaders, and general consuls from Mexico and Central America to discuss our immigration system and issues facing immigrant communities in the San Fernando Valley and across the U.S. https://t.co/eP06yVq98w

The #taxscam was never about helping middle-class and working families, it was always about making Trump's millionaire and billionaire friends richer.
The irresponsible Trump/Republican #TaxScam bill to help big corp. &amp; the ultra-wealthy has ballooned the U.S. deficit. The federal deficit will come close to $1t in 2019 and will expand by $800b over the next decade according to a new report by the CBO. https://t.co/klFYQjz9k4
The devastating effects of climate change are very real and happening before our eyes. The Amazon rainforest has been burning at a record rate. This deserves more attention from the media.

Trump's new rule to detain migrant children indefinitely is proof that he does not care about these children and is making decisions to help win reelection. This decision goes against our values and will only exacerbate the crisis at the border. #SaveFlores

@TomHolland1996 was the best #SpiderMan. This is very sad news. https://t.co/DYj4PlQEQa
The Trump Admin is forcing Planned Parenthood out of Title X program which will hurt women and families in low-income communities, rural towns, and communities of color. Their new rule will reduce access to vital healthcare services. This is part of Trump's anti-healthcare agenda https://t.co/ppQz7r6ntS
The public charge rule is an attack on legal immigrants and, ultimately, on tax-paying families, small biz, states &amp; local communities, &amp; American citizens. I'm proud that my home state of California is leading the fight against Trump's hateful policies.

Today, I held a business roundtable meeting at my office with business owners, entrepreneurs &amp; industry leaders to discuss the impacts of tariffs and Trump's trade wars, updates on the USMCA in Congress, and how we can encourage American innovation and entrepreneurship. https://t.co/sLhv890Dwh
7 years ago, Pres. Obama implemented #DACA. Today, hundreds of thousands of #DREAMERS are at risk of losing their legal status in the US. They are a part of our community --our neighbors, family &amp; friends. I‚Äôm fighting to #ProtectTheDream for #DREAMERS &amp; all #DACA #TPS recipients
We need leaders who are working to unify our country, not divide the American people. Republican leadership must stand up and condemn King‚Äôs comments. This is bigger than party politics, this is about the soul of our nation.
Rep. Steve King‚Äôs comments are disgusting and unbecoming of a United Stated Congressman. King has a history of making misogynistic, racist, and hateful statements that have no place in our society or the House of Representatives.
Social Security has been working for the people for 83 years. I will continue fighting to protect and strengthen Social Security that benefits millions of children and has been instrumental in lifting millions of seniors out of poverty. #SocSec84
This rule is outrageous and detrimental to American families and it will send our economy into a tailspin ultimately hurting our farmers and every industry that America is so proud of.
It is essential to a healthy American economy and stopping families from using benefits that will help them thrive hurts us all in the long run.
In 2014, immigrants in this country earned $1.3 trillion and paid more than $223 billion in federal taxes while paying another $105 billion in combined state and local taxes. A strong legal immigration system is critical for the prosperity of all Americans.
There goes Trump with another lose-lose proposal. This new rule is an attack on legal immigrants and ultimately, an attack on tax-paying families, small businesses, states and local communities, and American citizens. https://t.co/plPTnCZueK
Last week, I met with veterans Bill Olson and Rudy Calderon who served our country in the Army during #WWII. I thank them both for their service to and sacrifices for our country. I salute you both and all the brave men and women of the United States military. #CA29 https://t.co/wcN8o6QRYQ
This is heartbreaking. Everyone ‚Äîespecially my colleagues who oppose common sense gun-safety measures‚Äî should take the time to read &amp; hear how children in El Paso are talking about the shooting that took the lives of 22 ppl. We must act now.#EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/TQME8tm1Jp
#EidMubarak (Happy Eid) to all who are celebrating today! May this day be filled with joy, family, reflection, and, of course, good food.
Hundreds of children are left without their parents relying only on the kindness of neighbors for food and shelter. This is despicable and wrong. #ICEraids
Pres. Trump is hell-bent on traumatizing as many American children as possible. On the heels of a deadly terrorist attack directed against Latinos in America, Trump chooses to terrorize the communities of Mississippi. https://t.co/TLPZQRjdAV

30 seconds. That's how long it took for the gunman in Dayton, Ohio to brutally murder 9 innocent people. In 30 seconds, the lives of the victims' families were changed forever. 30 SECONDS!! 

What will it take for @senatemajldr to do something about this? #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/UJWa4iA81g
I woke up this morning to the news of another mass shooting in #Dayton less than 24 hours after the shooting in #ElPaso. I‚Äôm tired of the excuses. I‚Äôm tired of Congress‚Äôs unwillingness to act.

My prayers go out to the residents of El Paso &amp; the families affected by the shooting. We need more than just words. There have been 200+ mass shootings this year. We must address the gun violence epidemic in this country &amp; pass common sense gun-safety legislation. #NeverAgain
