The chaos in Syria almost endangered this important mission. ISIS is like Hydra and we can't let up. It's not about oil - it's about the safety and security of the United States.
The death of al-Baghdadi is good news for security of the US &amp; the world. Shows the importance of US leadership &amp; engagement with our allies in this fight.

@SpeakerPelosi I spoke with @MattLaslo about this trip, and my view of the Trump administration's efforts to force asylum seekers to remain outside of the U.S. while seeking asylum. You can read my thoughts in @vicenews 👇🏾

https://t.co/7R4wFa4ItI
@SpeakerPelosi It's clear to us that people are fleeing violence, persecution, and have credible fear for their lives. They should not be forced to seek asylum in a country that cannot offer them safety, nor should they be treated inhumanely when they arrive in America to legally seek asylum.
I recently joined @SpeakerPelosi on a Congressional trip to Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and McAllen, Texas to learn more about the refugee crisis happening to our south, and how we can help slow this crisis while treating those who come to America with decency and humanity. https://t.co/10tOi9LZS9

These problems predated the President, but have only gotten worse as a result of his complicity and lack of leadership. We have to act now to stem the tide of racial hatred and white supremacist violence in America.
White supremacists still think the President is on their side. Every opportunity he has to unequivocally disavow this ideology, he fails to stand up for the American people targeted by this violence.
Two years after white supremacists took to the streets in Charlottesville and committed an act of terror, the President still denies the threat they pose, and national security officials don't address the topic with the President because he is "not interested in those concerns." https://t.co/JIV60Bcy4t
