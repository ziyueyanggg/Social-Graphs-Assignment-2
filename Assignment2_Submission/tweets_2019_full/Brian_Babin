When you look at the facts, #MedicareForAll isn't confusing.
 
It...
✅ Costs $32 trillion over 10 years
✅ Raises taxes 
✅ Eliminates private/employer insurance leaving 158 million without coverage
 
If passed, you can say goodbye to choices and freedom! https://t.co/8iVebPvhSn

This Father's Day, I would like to take a moment to honor the memory of my father, Philip Babin, Jr. He was a great father who taught me how to be a man and always led by example. I love and miss him dearly.

You could clearly see the path that so many had taken to break our laws and enter into our country.

It's a disgrace. https://t.co/oAAS8zLXLk
