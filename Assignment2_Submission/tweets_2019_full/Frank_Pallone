These automakers’ decision to align themselves with @POTUS' anti-climate agenda for the sake of a little short-term profit and reprieve from @POTUS’ Twitter tirades will do long-term damage, both to the automotive industry and to our country.

With more than 40,000 Americans dying from asbestos-related diseases each year, and @EPA failing to adequately protect Americans from PFAS chemicals, we are happy to be moving these legislative solutions forward to the full Committee.
Today we advanced 15 bills that would finally ban asbestos once and for all, address the crisis of PFAS “forever chemicals” contaminating everything from our water to our household supplies, and tackle the storage challenge presented by nuclear fuel. https://t.co/UITbWeSyKS
I joined the launch of the No Surprises coalition, a group of consumer advocates fighting to pass legislation to safeguard patients from surprise medical bills. Together we are going to pass my bill, the No Surprises Act, to protect consumers and end #SurpriseMedicalBills. https://t.co/c1BWWFIzo3
Good for Monmouth Park. They deserve to collect damages after the leagues argued in bad faith to block sports betting in New Jersey. In the meantime, they were profiting off daily fantasy leagues and moving a team to Las Vegas.

I’m wearing black today in our fight to #EndGunViolence. Too many American families have suffered from the gun violence epidemic. When will enough be enough @senatemajldr? https://t.co/8IfH5glwIA
It's incredible that the president thought that releasing this conversation would exonerate him of wrongdoing. Congress needs the full unredacted whistleblower report so that we can get the full extent of @realdonaldtrump’s abuse of power. https://t.co/irijOZANjw
We need #ClimateActionNow to protect our oceans and planet before it’s too late. https://t.co/IGeMsApguK
The science is abundantly clear - #ClimateChange is severely damaging our oceans. Oceans absorb a third of our carbon emissions and 90% of the planet's excess heat. Read more about the UN’s report below 👇 https://t.co/Bfi8F3ttxd
This morning my Committee is holding a hearing on my legislation and several other bills that would allow Medicare to negotiate #LowerDrugCosts for all Americans. It’s time we negotiate a better deal for all Americans. https://t.co/ZR4PrnO3Qh
@EnergyCommerce @US_FDA @CDCgov If you talk to any parent of a high school student, you know that our nation’s e-cigarette problem is real – and getting worse.  

It's clear that we must enact my comprehensive legislation to fully address this growing youth epidemic.
WATCH: At an @EnergyCommerce hearing today, I called on @US_FDA and @CDCgov to address youth vaping and e-cigarette usage in a meaningful way. 

I am deeply concerned about the recent outbreak of lung illnesses that have killed eight people and sickened hundreds. https://t.co/XOgRr7ZLfB
Thanks @AARPNJ for supporting our legislation to #LowerDrugCostsNow. Millions of Americans are suffering because of skyrocketing prescription drug prices. Our bill will lower drug prices through negotiation and cap out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors. https://t.co/0gaBqtJA4k
Looking forward to the expanded role of the House Recycling Caucus, which I Co-Chair with @RepShimkus. Today’s briefing focused on the state of recycling in the U.S. and the challenges and opportunities facing the recycling industry. https://t.co/6pZfwppUds
It’s time for Congress to exercise its constitutional authority and impeach the president in order to protect the rule of law and our democracy. No one – not even the President of the United States - is above the law. https://t.co/ZrYh5l8pJX
Any plan to #LowerDrugCosts has to empower Medicare to negotiate with drug companies. My new legislation does exactly that, and then ensures those negotiated prices are available to all Americans. https://t.co/8zdOQZvPp7
This Wednesday, my Committee will hold a legislative hearing on HR 3 and several others as we continue our work to lower drug costs for all Americans. https://t.co/exkL1Ga1n2
Last week, I introduced HR 3, the #LowerDrugCost Now Act, which will make prescription drugs more affordable for Americans by allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices. At a press conference last week, I explained the legislation &amp; what it would mean to consumers. https://t.co/0v3WdaWN61
New Jersey’s farmers are feeling the effects of the #ClimateCrisis firsthand. 

One of the many reasons why we need to #ActOnClimate and enact a plan to achieve net zero carbon pollution by 2050.

Trump’s stonewalling on reports that he pressured Ukrainian leaders to investigate VP Biden’s son is unacceptable and illegal. I applaud the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation into this matter. Congress must have the full account of the whistleblower’s complaint.
It’s sad the measures that schools are having to take to fight the vaping epidemic. Next week my Committee is holding a hearing on the public health risks of e-cigarettes. https://t.co/Pom0M0XI4h

It’s likely we can decarbonize certain sectors, like power, even faster – a goal we share. But the global scientific consensus makes clear that all sectors – our entire country – must be carbon neutral by 2050. #ClimateFriday #ActonClimate https://t.co/dDx52aSAcM
That’s why in July, I announced a plan to develop bold, comprehensive legislation to decarbonize our entire economy and achieve net zero greenhouse gas pollution no later than 2050. https://t.co/43zIQmtXI1
I could not agree more that #climatechange is a crisis that demands our immediate action. I’ve heard the calls to unite behind the science and let the science dictate how we proceed.
Last year, 29% of Americans didn’t take their medication as prescribed due to high costs! 
 
That’s why @SpeakerPelosi and I introduced the #LowerDrugCosts Act to cut prescription drug prices through negotiation. 
https://t.co/VCY2h2SQ64
This #ClimateFriday, I’m hearing from a panel of experts on how we can decarbonize the U.S. building sector, which is responsible for nearly 40% of our carbon pollution. Any plan for combating the #ClimateCrisis MUST include bringing this sector to net zero emissions. #100By50 https://t.co/vGoN0F6Jzt

Met with Armenian Ambassador to the US Varuzhan Nersesyan. We discussed the importance of supporting the information technology sector in #Armenia.
Today I introduced H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, which gives the federal government the authority to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies to bring down costs for all consumers. #LowerDrugCosts https://t.co/V4mvjcGTXK
I spoke on the House Floor today in support of HR 4378, which funds the government, extends key health programs and includes an important provision to ensure the 9/11 World Trade Center Health Program remains open and accessible to responders and survivors. https://t.co/WA3cGPAtXN
As part of @EnergyCommerce's continuing effort to combat the opioid crisis, several Committee leaders and I sent letters to 16 states to examine how funding is being used by states to aid opioid use disorder treatment, recovery and prevention efforts.

It’s time that we negotiate a better deal for the American people. It’s time for the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act. https://t.co/74CFk7UuvE
For years, the American people have been subsidizing prescription drugs for the rest of the world – under the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act those days are over.
Across America, seniors and families are struggling to afford the prescription drugs they need to stay healthy. It’s time for Congress to act to #LowerDrugCosts! https://t.co/ZdtnJhD8Bl
LIVE NOW! I'm joining House health leaders as we announce the introduction of bold legislation to #LowerDrugCosts for all Americans. https://t.co/umRXhk7mtN
9/11 first responders &amp; survivors deserve our resolute support. I’ll never forget the sacrifices made on that day &amp; the months after. That’s why I led the fight to raise the cap on those eligible to enroll under the 9/11 World Trade Center Health Program.
https://t.co/GEZbcfvQSr
For years, Big Pharma has sent the prices of lifesaving medication soaring, with little regard for the impact on working Americans. That ends today. Tune in at 10:45 am ET as @HouseDemocrats unveil the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act: https://t.co/UJ2yZFZwmm
GOOD NEWS: The CR to fund the government TRIPLES the caps on enrollment in the 9/11 World Trade Center Health Program. I’m pleased we reached an agreement ensuring 9/11 responders and survivors will be able to enroll in the program for years to come.

The industrial sector is a source of good jobs and products critical for our economy. At the same time, it's the 3rd largest source of greenhouse gas pollution. Today, we’re hearing from experts in @EnergyCommerce on solutions to this challenge so we can achieve #100By50. https://t.co/X4cUbhmEKm
Great to see young advocates for #Armenia on Capitol Hill for the Independence Day Reception. In the aftermath of the Velvet Revolution, it is more important than ever for the US to support the new Armenian government. https://t.co/gSzdZdBMcq
Great news: Tonight the House acted unanimously to give New Jersey the flexibility and resources it needs to replace lead pipes and give the people of Newark clean water.

I expedited passage of this bill, because everyone deserves clean drinking water.
