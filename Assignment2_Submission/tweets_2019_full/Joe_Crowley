The current system is shaped by injustice and hinders our ability to lead in the 21st-century.

The Trump administration isn‚Äôt just failing to lead when it comes to the treatment of refugees - the president is failing a moral test. And as a country, we will be judged by our response to the suffering these humans are being forced to endure.

The GOP controls the House of Representatives, Senate, and the White House.
 
The onus is on them.
Congress will closely watch Hurricane Florence and stand ready to help any community that requires support following the storm. Our prayers are with those families as the hurricane approaches the coast.

- Fa‚Ä¶RT @.@repjoecrowley: Yesterday, the president said his response to Puerto Rico was a ‚Äòsuccess.‚Äô

- 2975 Americans dead
- Families without power &amp; water for months
- The island struggling to rebuild 

That‚Äôs what @POTUS calls a success. I have another phrase for it: abject failure.
Deeply saddened to hear of the loss of former Queens Deputy Borough President Lawrence Gresser. He was a loyal friend to all of us. Sending warm thoughts to his wife Carol and the Gresser family during this difficult time.
My cousin John Moran was a @FDNY battalion chief. He was off duty on 9/11, but refused to leave his brothers behind.
 
I wrote the following tribute at a time when I was still struggling to grasp the fact that he was no longer with us.
 
I miss you, John. https://t.co/tpIjl1KKeY https://t.co/7FlJaS2M1m
Today is also a stark reminder of the gratitude we still owe the heroes who answered our nation‚Äôs call. We remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice and the first responders and workers who continue to battle cancer and other ailments as a result of their selfless actions.
As we reflect on this solemn day, we must #NeverForget that there is far more that unites us than divides us, and that America can meet any challenge when we come together. https://t.co/5EnHcXAnCh
A coastal flood advisory is in effect for the southern portion of Queens until tomorrow afternoon ‚Äì stay safe, everyone! https://t.co/1JMn1PyWaz

.@FoodBank4NYC works tirelessly to serve our community and end hunger. I am so proud to work with them in their efforts and support them on #NatonalFoodBankDay and every day.
House Republicans passed a $2 trillion tax break for the wealthy. Now they‚Äôre using the #FarmBill to try to cut #SNAP and leave millions of the most vulnerable Americans hungry.

I‚Äôm proud India took this critical step toward recognizing that love is love. There‚Äôs still more work to do to ensure full equality for all of India‚Äôs LGBT community, but today, I‚Äôm celebrating with you on this historic victory.

President Trump is going to extreme lengths to indefinitely detain migrant families. When will my Republican colleagues stand up to the President's total disregard for our courts? https://t.co/Dkcq0l4ln0
Republicans are using our court systems to try and rip health care away from millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. They have no shame. ‚Üì https://t.co/xLpA0q3Bcp
Welcome #BackToSchoolNYC! Hope you all had a wonderful #FirstDayOfSchool. And a big THANK YOU to all of our phenomenal teachers who are molding tomorrow‚Äôs leaders!
Judge Kavanaugh is a threat to the progress we‚Äôve made on health care and reproductive rights. We can‚Äôt allow him to take us backwards. #WhatsAtStake https://t.co/ONt4BW4y09
Republicans can‚Äôt govern and they can‚Äôt lead. https://t.co/BCZNNJsHfz
President Trump and Republicans are trying to take away protections for the over 8 million New Yorkers living with a pre-existing condition. I stand with them - and the millions of Americans - who say we must #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/f27WafAdvJ
America's working men and women are the foundation of our nation. This #LaborDay, @HouseDemocrats are reaffirming our work to ensure that working families prosper and our economy benefits all. https://t.co/IDFbHRHVwl
Was honored today to present an American flag flown over the U.S. Capitol to Officer Osvaldo Nunez, who heroically saved the life of an infant during his first month on the job. Thank you for your bravery, Officer Nunez ‚Äì Queens is grateful for your service! https://t.co/FAuUa7es3Q
The Trump administration wants to put guns in our children's schools. Can we stop pretending now that they aren‚Äôt bought and sold by the NRA? https://t.co/k2VB2o7ZeW
The U.N. was right to call this genocide. Now, our State Department must do the same. https://t.co/jCp8pm9Hlu
Senator McCain had the heart of a warrior and was a patriot in every sense of the word. My heart is with the McCain family and I join the entire country in mourning the loss of a great man.
Beautiful day to join @FranciscoMoyaNY and @aridia_espinal for their back to school event in Corona! https://t.co/GsMhObmYbw
John McCain is an American hero. Wishing peace and comfort to the Senator and his family during this impossibly difficult time. https://t.co/UCihKu0ZOD
Servicemembers need #NetNeutrality to contact their loved ones, but without a free and open Internet, big telecom companies can block their streaming services. Our troops and veterans deserve better. https://t.co/L0C1XsqMQP

Mr. Palij should stand trial for his crimes, and I thank the German government for taking responsibility by accepting this deportation.
This is a long-overdue step toward justice and peace for victims of the Holocaust. I‚Äôm proud to have worked with the State Dept. to ensure that this former Nazi guard does not continue to live in Queens‚Äîa community that stands proud in its love for all. https://t.co/wKCEPayDj0
Our nation mourns the loss of the great Aretha Franklin, one of the most celebrated and important performers of all time. She was truly the Queen of Soul and an incredible champion for social justice. She will be missed. https://t.co/axkfsKvt8e
The Trump administration‚Äôs top priority is terrorizing immigrant families and communities of color. Our city will not cower in the face of this injustice, and we will always stand by our neighbors.

Our country could afford to create Social Security during the Great Depression. We can absolutely afford to protect and expand it now.  #SocSec83

My prayers are with the entire Moran family in this difficult time. https://t.co/xLfdpSMidl
42% of New Yorkers have a pre-existing condition. Their access to health insurance will be threatened if President Trump and Republicans succeed in their attacks on the Affordable Care Act. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/qGKbfET6NS
Repealing #NetNeutrality has real consequences for consumers, slowing down your internet access and charging you extra fees. We must restore the free and open internet and stop the @FEC from allowing companies to charge us more for less. https://t.co/FbWVp7Z9Kn

Six years ago, the lives of six  worshippers were taken in an act of hate at the Sikh Gurdwara in Oak Creek, WI. This solemn day is a painful reminder that we cannot waver in our stand against bigotry and intolerance. https://t.co/4q0GBYJs7k
Here‚Äôs an idea: write a bill to help NY families, not to pick a political fight. https://t.co/SBBOq3FYmB
An overwhelming majority of Americans across party lines support #NetNeutrality. It's time for House Republicans to listen to them and schedule a vote to ensure the internet is accessible to all. https://t.co/yHtH0WjiCa
Raising the minimum wage for #PuertoRico‚Äôs construction workers will go a long way in helping working families AND attracting the skilled workforce that is so critical for the island's recovery. https://t.co/AXLodJbMYQ

Instead of doing everything in their power to bring families back together, the Trump administration complained and made excuses. And now, hundreds of kids are still without their parents. https://t.co/eVsQFdD7ln

After losing their son Rory to sepsis, Orlaith &amp; Ciaran Staunton fought tirelessly to update NY‚Äôs sepsis care protocols to help prevent more tragedies. 
 
New research shows their efforts are working. Thank you Orlaith &amp; Ciaran for your leadership. https://t.co/YxJkey5tkF
Brett Kavanaugh has made it clear that he wants to overturn #RoevWade. If the Senate appoints him‚Äîor any other anti-choice Justice‚ÄîI commit to supporting legislation to protect women's access to abortion. #CommitToRoe. https://t.co/ZVSifA5cmj
Right now, a college education can saddle students with a lifetime of debt. That is just wrong.

Gutting the @NYDailyNews newsroom is a huge blow for journalism and NYC. A robust local press is essential to ensuring accountability and transparency.
Secretary Nielsen separates children from their parents and defends white supremacists. She needs to resign. https://t.co/2z5OO6OsEy
We cannot allow the Trump administration to politicize the #2020Census. Adding a citizenship question is a purely racist policy meant to eliminate the political representation and resources our communities need and deserve.

Putin undermined our Democracy and abused his power. And now President Trump is inviting him to the White House. This is not being ‚Äústrong on Russia.‚Äù https://t.co/BSu6aoPrLt
Incredibly excited that @SenKamalaHarris introduced the Senate-version of my bill, the Rent Relief Act, to bring housing affordability to renters all over the U.S. With rents skyrocketing and wages stagnant, hard-working middle-class families need relief. https://t.co/SfegmNB9Bd
Proud to see @RepAnnWagner‚Äôs and my bill to help prevent mass atrocities pass the House yesterday. This is an important first step in the future to fight genocide across the world.
