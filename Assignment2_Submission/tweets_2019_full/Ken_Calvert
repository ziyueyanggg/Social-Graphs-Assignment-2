Today, I voted for legislation (H.R. 4695) to impose sanctions on Turkey in response to its offensive against U.S.-allied Kurdish troops in northern Syria. We should send a clear message that this aggression is unacceptable.
I have long supported having the United States officially recognize the Armenian Genocide and the atrocities that took place. That’s why I cosponsored H.Res. 296 and voted for its passage today in the House.

After having their non-transparent impeachment process resoundingly criticized, the Speaker is rushing a bill to the House floor that’s only designed to fool Americans into thinking this process is fair &amp; transparent. It’s neither, and this resolution does nothing to change that.
As Majority Leader McConnell points out, Democrats are so driven by their opposition to anything supported by the White House they are threatening to block funding for our troops, &amp; delay military assistance funding for Ukraine. Their actions defy logic and are purely political. https://t.co/N6P4ZKE61J

@CDCgov The #opioid crisis continues to destroy lives and families across our nation, including right here in Riverside County. I am committed to working with all of our federal, state and local partners to implement life-saving solutions to this deadly problem.
Today, @CDCgov announced it's awarding $2.4 mil to the Riv. Co. Dept. of Public Health to combat the opioid crisis. The funding will provide critical resources &amp; tools to Riv. Co. health officials to combat opioid-related overdoses &amp; deaths in our region. https://t.co/pKYAXpYK40

The @PalmSpringsPD, @RivCoDA, jury and judge did their part in serving justice to the killer of officers Vega and Zerbny. It's not easy to sentence someone to die. I'm thankful we have citizens who have the courage to serve, stand up and carry out justice for the fallen. https://t.co/dQAHWCKhfW
I am an original cosponsor of the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act (H.R. 4194) to designate 9-8-8 as the universal telephone number for a national suicide prevention, mental health crisis, and veteran’s crisis hotline system. This will be a life-saving resource.

Instances of animal abuse are often linked to other crimes, including the abuse of children. That’s why I've cosponsored the Child &amp; Animal Abuse Detection &amp; Reporting Act (H.R. 2808) to incorporate data on animal abuse in the national clearinghouse for child abuse info.

Last night we lost a hero. I join our law enforcement community in grieving for fallen @CHPInland  officer Andre Moye. I’m praying for the other injured officers and thankful for those who responded to take down the coward who perpetrated this attack.
Instead of guaranteeing outcomes, we need to remain vigilant in ensuring there’s equal economic opportunities to lift up every family. Read my op-ed on why we must reject the Democratic Party’s embrace of socialism: https://t.co/tlGK5gVCqm
We all agree that we have to find ways to stop these horrific attacks, so let’s focus on solutions and compassion for our fellow Americans, rather than rhetoric and division.
We must do more to root out hate driven ideologies - like white supremacy, Antifa and others - that use violence to terrorize our communities.
Democrats in California have imposed the nation’s highest state sales tax, highest income tax, and the highest gas tax. Now they are trying to weaken Prop. 13 tax protections. They are coming for more of your hard earned money to pay for their socialist policies. https://t.co/Xrsth6dlyi

We should all agree that our nation continues to face threats to the integrity of our elections. That’s why I have cosponsored the Election Security Assistance Act (H.R. 341) to strengthen cooperation between local election administrators and federal elections stakeholders.

Violent crimes are committed across Indian country at alarming rates. I have cosponsored Savanna’s Act (H.R. 2733) to close the data collection gap by providing resources to local jurisdictions to properly record violent crimes against indigenous people.
I have cosponsored the Finding Orphan-disease Remedies with Antifungal Research and Development (FORWARD) Act (H.R. 2858) to address the short, medium, and long-term goals of combating Valley Fever, which has been on the rise in Riverside County.
I’m ready to have those conversations now because time will only make matters worse.
Today, seven out of every ten dollars spent by the federal government is on non-discretionary programs. Until we can discuss cost savings on the non-discretionary side of the budget we’re just not being serious about solutions to our fiscal challenges.
I support the agreement because it’s in the best interest of our national security. Like any agreement in a divided government, I don’t agree with everything. I’m frustrated that we keep punting on the tough decisions needed to fix our budgetary imbalance.
As the top Republican on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I’ve been advocating for a top-line budget agreement to avoid the defense cuts triggered by sequestration that would undermine the tremendous progress we’ve made rebuilding our military.
Exciting news for our region. I truly appreciate Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s decision to award the grant and for all the time she took speaking with me to understand the transportation challenges in our region. Great job Temecula! https://t.co/gMkOCUhvex
