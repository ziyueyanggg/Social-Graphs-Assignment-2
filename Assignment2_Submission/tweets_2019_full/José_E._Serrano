Also, important to note that there is language in my @AppropsDems FY 2020 bill approved in the House, that prevents funds from being used to include a #CitizenshipQuestion. #WeCount https://t.co/JqHiKnKUxh
The #SCOTUS decision is a victory for those of us who believe in a fair &amp; accurate #2020Census. There is no justification for the #citizenshipquestion, and now there is no time to include it.  I expect the @uscensusbureau to print the form without the question. #WeCount
Proud to see the House pass H.R. 3055, which includes my @AppropsDems CJS FY 2020 bill that invests in #justicereform, economic development, the science agencies, programs, research focused on #climatechange, &amp; addresses #gunviolence. I urge the Senate to pass this bill. https://t.co/T8BWZTNiEm

Wishing my son @SenatorSerrano a very Happy Birthday!!!!
4) Protection of civil rights through a $20 million increase for the @USEEOC, increasing funding for access to legal services in poor communities, &amp; improving @DOJ's capacity to enforce civil rights laws. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.
3) $501M for @DOJ will help stem opioid abuse &amp; expand addiction treatment, along with funding to fight drug trafficking, reduce crime, and help address gun violence.
2) Significant funding increase for the @CensusBureau &amp; a provision to block the inclusion of a citizenship question in the #2020Census.
1) $5.49 billion for @NOAA for #climatechange research, weather forecasting improvements, &amp; scientific research. It also includes significant funding for the @NSF &amp; @NASA to foster scientific research &amp; innovation, &amp; to boost economic competitiveness.
The CJS bill provides $74 billion to help address climate change, fund STEM education &amp; research, &amp; promote civil rights among others. As Chairman of this subcommittee and drafter of the bill, I‚Äôm particularly proud it includes: https://t.co/sou5h77JAp

2) Recognizing the importance of climate change, the State &amp; Foreign Ops bill eliminates the prohibition of the Green Climate Fund &amp; prohibits the use of funds to withdraw from the Paris Climate agreement. It also provides billions to support global health and basic education.
As a senior member of the @AppropsDems there are a couple of Democratic successes in H.R.2740 that I want to highlight: 1)For the first time in 20 years, the FY20 Labor-HHS-Education bill provides funding for @CDCgov/@NIH to conduct firearm injury &amp; mortality prevention research.
Today, the House started considering a package of 4 Approps bills (Labor-HHS-Education, Defense, State &amp; Foreign Ops, and Energy &amp; Water) that rejects @POTUS‚Äôs harmful budget cuts toüçéeducation, üè• health care &amp; more. Watch LIVE ‚Üí https://t.co/2gCcJGeLYV
