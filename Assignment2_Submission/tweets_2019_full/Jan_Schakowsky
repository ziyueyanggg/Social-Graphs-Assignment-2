Also, the same Administration that ran on Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private emails has been caught red handed using an encrypted text message service ‚Äì WhatsApp ‚Äì to conceal their communications outside of official government channels as is required by standing policy.
Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations, Ambassador Kurt Volker, recently resigned from the State Department and turned over these messages. He knows where this is going and is trying to get out of the way.
Question: Why was Trump political appointee, Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, involved in this at all? Ukraine is not a member of the European Union.
Distinguished career diplomat, Ambassador Bill Taylor, wrote at the time, ‚ÄúAs I said on the phone, I think it‚Äôs crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.‚Äù
The threat to Ukraine from Russia is real ‚Äì Russia has invaded its territory and poses an existential threat to its existence.
THREAD - To My Constituents: Take a moment to read the communications between State Department employees verifying they knew Trump was trying to withhold essential security aid to Ukraine in exchange for help with his reelection.
