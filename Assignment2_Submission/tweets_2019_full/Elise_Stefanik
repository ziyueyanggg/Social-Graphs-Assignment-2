The American people deserve a Congress that works on behalf of the people instead of engaging in Speaker Pelosi and far-left Democrats' political games. https://t.co/KuZg7oJjWX
However, today the American people witnessed unprecedented partisanship of House Democrats as Speaker Pelosi‚Äôs inappropriate words against the President were stricken from the parliamentarian's record. This is the first time this has happened since the 1980s.

Watch me speak on the House Floor earlier this week about the FY2020 NDAA: https://t.co/zxyWLLVWGt
I anticipate this bill will improve as we work with the Senate in Conference, and am hopeful that a truly bipartisan NDAA will be the result.
While I support portions of this bill, I am deeply concerned it fails to fulfill our role as a legislative body and does not reflect a longstanding tradition of robust bipartisan support.
The House was not given time to debate the Democrat‚Äôs partisan efforts to close Guantanamo Bay and bring terrorists to the United States. Bottom line: it deeply diminishes our military readiness.
It reduces the defense funding number by over $16 billion, hinders the modernization of our nuclear triad, limits the Commander-in-Chief's constitutional authority to respond to military threats, and does not allow him to send troops to the border to enforce our immigration laws.
But with the Democrat‚Äôs partisan provisions that were added on the Floor, I could not in good conscience vote for this legislation.
I was 1 of 2 Republicans to vote for the NDAA in committee in hopes that we could improve it through the amendment process. Today, I voted for the bipartisan amendment to the bill that would have given our military a pay raise &amp; increased the top line defense number.
In my district, I am proud to be a leader and fierce advocate for Fort Drum by ensuring it is recognized as a fully capable defense post, and ensuring it has the funding it needs to operate and accomplish its critical mission.
THREAD: I am disappointed that Democrats have chosen to make the FY20 NDAA a partisan bill. The principle role of Congress in national security is to protect our homeland and provide our men and women in uniform with the resources they need to execute their mission on our behalf.
I was proud to be an original cosponsor of the Never Forget Our Heroes Act to permanently #Renew911VCF. The House just passed it with strong, bipartisan support.
