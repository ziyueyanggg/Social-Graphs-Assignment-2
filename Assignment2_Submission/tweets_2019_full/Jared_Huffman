And most importantly ‚Äì thank you to our first responders and to everyone who has shown such patience and resilience in the face of this disaster, which still threatens our community. Look out for each other and be kind to one another. We will get through this together.
It is important to remember that we have a commitment from Homeland Security that those seeking shelter or services would NOT be subject to immigration enforcement. ICE will not be at evacuation sites, resource centers, or food banks. Please don‚Äôt be afraid to seek help!
We are still at risk of high winds kicking up the fires. Our firefighters are well-trained professionals and are ready to act, but they need space to do their job and can‚Äôt be distracted by saving people who should be evacuated.
I'm on the ground w/ our heroic first responders to see first-hand the latest on the #KincadeFire. The readiness &amp; coordinated response I‚Äôve seen is truly impressive, but we aren't in the clear yet. Everyone in Sonoma County who remains under an evacuation order should stay away. https://t.co/rP2tG7ADgk
I understand the anger towards PG&amp;E. Once we are out of this immediate crisis, we will focus accountability &amp; reforms. But please ‚Äì respect the line workers &amp; treat them w/ gratitude. They are here to help you, and we should not turn our frustrations with PG&amp;E execs on them.
Plastic pollution is an epidemic - &amp; we must do something about it. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important we begin now: to save our oceans, wildlife, &amp; communities. Thank you, @RepLowenthal for standing in for me during this important hearing while I'm on the ground of the #KincadeFire https://t.co/YGBhqqjN8N
