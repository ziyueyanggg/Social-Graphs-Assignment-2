The final version of the Farm Bill epitomizes much of what is wrong with Washington. Faced with a significant opportunity to impact real change, Congress took the easy way out and succumbed to the status quo.
The #FarmBill was a rare opportunity to turn the tide in the failed ‚ÄòWar on Poverty.‚Äô By incentivizing hard work and self-sufficiency, welfare work requirements could have helped millions of Americans escape the cycle of poverty.

I am horrified and heartbroken by the vile attack on Tree of Life Synagogue this morning. Anti-semitism will not be tolerated and has no place in our society. We must come together to put an end to such acts of violence and hatred.
The attempted attacks today are reprehensible, cowardly and anti-American. There is absolutely no place for political violence in our democracy. I am thankful no one was hurt and applaud law enforcement personnel and first responders for their bravery and swift response.
Our economy keeps getting better and better!
