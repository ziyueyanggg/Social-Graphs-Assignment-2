The Terrace St. off-ramp ribbon cutting was today. @LouisianaGov highlighted this is step 1 in reducing congestion and adding capacity in the bridge to the 10/12 split.

I want to thank @LouisianaGov, @onevisionary, @RickWardLA, @ReginaBarrow, @stevecarter4la , @EdwardTedJames, @MayorBroome, @TaraWicker1 and so many others that worked with us to ensure these funds were spent on this important project. https://t.co/33MSOOsMeC
Finally, we will eliminate a 40-year problem, we will improve traffic flow &amp; safety, and lay the groundwork for a new Miss River bridge. Transportation is a pervasive problem in our area and we are plucking projects off the to-do list 1 by 1. https://t.co/33MSOOsMeC
This is one of those transportation problems that should have been fixed decades ago.  This one-lane I-10 bottleneck, the only one of its kind in America, is nearly gone.  This completion is key to solving some of the worse traffic in the nation. https://t.co/sT8nkMMvbK
I’ve said it before, today’s ribbon cutting of the Terrace St. exit is a game changer.  Not because it is suddenly going to fix all of our traffic problems — rather, it is an indication that traffic solutions are finally a priority in the Capitol Region.
Great to be able to kick-off the official opening of the @DSHSJackets STEM and Robotics Center.  #LPProud https://t.co/JR1WTSVIRS
We have to get better at understanding, detecting, preventing, &amp; treating autism. Every year, more families in the US are impacted.
