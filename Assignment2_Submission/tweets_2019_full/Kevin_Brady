This partisan bill, written in secret, is already DOA in Senate.  

Why? 
Trades lower drug prices in short term for fewer lifesaving cures in future.
Less access to latest drugs for U.S. patients. 
Rewards drug companies for delaying cures.

Economists constantly debate what these figures mean, but for @PolitiFactTexas to declare one report definitive over the other, citing two liberal economists, and reach  conclusion of "mostly false" - that's just not credible.  

Next time: Maybe less "politics" &amp; more "fact."
Another key measure - the share of money income - reinforces WHY income inequality declined:  

The "share of the pie" for the lowest, second and middle fifths of Americans grew - improved - while the highest earners share shrunk. 

That's good news.
