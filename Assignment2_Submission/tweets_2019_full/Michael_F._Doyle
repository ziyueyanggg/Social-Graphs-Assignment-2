@DorisMatsui @RepBillJohnson I’m looking forward to more discussion of this bipartisan bill in @EnergyCommerce next week – it’s time to make smart use of our spectrum and address the needs of underserved Americans while protecting current C-Band users. https://t.co/qiodJiS1oL
Today, @DorisMatsui, @RepBillJohnson, Representative Greg Gianforte, and I introduced H.R. 4855, the C-BAND Act, which would require the public auction of C-Band spectrum to promote competition, spur the 5G revolution, and benefit all Americans.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Pittsburghers want to leave their kids a better environment, and they know we can have both good jobs AND a growing, sustainable economy. @POTUS’ continued attacks on environmental protections conflict with our work to create jobs and promote sustainable development.
Once again @realDonaldTrump has tried to take credit for things he had nothing to do with. Pittsburgh’s comeback predates @POTUS. Our city has a diverse economy with good-paying jobs and a clean environment.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS After Ambassador Taylor’s testimony, it’s clear the impeachment inquiry is finding important new facts and uncovering the full extent of the @realDonaldTrump’s schemes. Our national security depends on the inquiry moving forward.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Ambassador Taylor’s 15-page statement documents a President who’s unconcerned about corruption – but who sees US aid to countries under attack as a transaction and US military spending as a blank check for his personal political use.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Ambassador Taylor outlined Ukraine’s desperate need for security funding to fight Russian aggression – and President Trump’s decision to withhold that funding. His top cabinet officials confirmed this was done to pressure Ukraine into announcing a political investigation.
Ambassador Taylor’s opening statement clearly laid out the @realDonaldTrump’s “shadow diplomacy” and its extensive efforts to blackmail Ukraine into launching an investigation into a @POTUS political rival. https://t.co/3jUU6Ny39T

The House just passed H.R. 1423, the FAIR Act, to prohibit mandatory arbitration clauses and restore the rights of consumers and workers to sue. This is a significant victory for workers who face racial discrimination, sexual harassment, or workplace rights violations.
You shouldn't have to sign away your right to a fair trial in order to get a job, but corporate contracts often force consumers and employees to settle disputes in private arbitration. This process favors corporations - no judge or jury - and consumers and workers have no choice.

Today, I visited @NewCentCareers, an education and training organization for manufacturing workers in #PGH. It was great to hear from students who are working hard and building important skills that will help them to get quality jobs in this in-demand field. https://t.co/IX9p9JwG5I
Stopped by @EICPittsburgh for an update on its latest sustainability efforts. They’re doing important work to build a greener future, create jobs, and promote economic growth in #PGH. https://t.co/lUfITEApiL
Dreamers are contributing members of our communities, workplaces, and campuses. It’s been 7 years since the implementation of DACA, and we must continue protections for these individuals who were brought here as children and raised to call this country home. #DreamAndPromiseNOW https://t.co/sutBNzyVwX
Mill 19 is one of the last remaining buildings from LTV Steel works in Hazelwood. Now it's been repurposed to house @CMUEngineering and @ARM_Robotics and a number of other high-tech tenants. Its opening today is the first major step in revitalizing the entire 175-acre site. https://t.co/IyaDABCLwN
Tune in! I’m welcoming my Democratic Colleagues on the House Homeland Security Committee to #PGH for a roundtable on domestic terrorism. We must continue to discuss ways to prevent terrible events like the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue last year.

With 20 veterans, servicemembers, reservists, and members of the National Guard dying by suicide a day, it’s clear we have a national public health crisis on our hands—addressing it is a top priority. https://t.co/gGiiqJWFUt
Hope everyone had a great #LaborDay in #PGH! It is important to celebrate hardworking Americans and the role of unions in making our workplaces better. Thanks for the clip, @ACE_Fitzgerald! https://t.co/UlTRGE3zeW
Dorian has already hit with devastating impact in the Bahamas and claimed five lives. Wishing safety for all families in its path, please take all precautions over the next few days.
Grieving for Texas after the senseless mass shooting on Saturday. My heart goes out to the victims’ families and friends, and my thanks to brave first responders. #EnoughIsEnough!
On #LaborDay, we honor American workers - and remember those who fought for safe working conditions, fair compensation, and a better future for all workers. Today and every day, we must keep our promises to workers and protect their rights. https://t.co/NLhagqk2iq
It was great to celebrate Wilkinsburg Community Day! Nice to see you, Mayor Marita Garrett! https://t.co/WOrx2lrDIT
Yesterday, I joined the Brookline Honor Roll Plaque Dedication honoring 56 servicemen who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our Country in WW I, WW II, Korea and Vietnam. https://t.co/dsd9bcQASA
.@POTUS' decision to divert funding from FEMA to keep detention centers running is irresponsible. FEMA must have the resources it needs to help American communities in the midst of hurricane season. 
https://t.co/KaNTgpXctO
.@POTUS wants to reverse another critical and commonsense protection. Methane is a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change and harm human health. #ClimateActionNow

Individuals with autism spectrum disorders have unique needs, and we should ensure they have support throughout their lives. It’s great that to hear that the bipartisan @NAtlAssnAttysGn agrees – and supports H.R. 1058, the Autism CARES Act, my bill with @RepChrisSmith! https://t.co/pDYbCNyzif

After meeting with @NewVoicesPgh today, I will be signing on as a cosponsor of H.R. 1692, the EACH Woman Act to repeal the Hyde Amendment and ensure equal access to reproductive health services regardless of socioeconomic status. #ReproJustice https://t.co/Wk8ddsONai
Yesterday, @RepGainey and I visited Wood Towers to hear from tenants about their concerns with accessibility, security, and affordability. I’m working to make sure that all public housing meets the needs of its residents. https://t.co/NvQr7vc1TT
I recently joined @JonDelano to talk about our accomplishments in the House so far this year. We’ve passed a number of important bills already, and we’ll be working on more in September. Now we just have to get the Senate to approve them! Check it out:
https://t.co/Ir7cX3BoEU
The costs of prescription medications have skyrocketed, and a recent @AARP study confirms this has caused many Pennsylvanians to stop taking the medications that keep them healthy. The Senate should stop stalling on bills that promote competition and lower costs for Americans! https://t.co/IbrHJw3ko2
Pennsylvanians like Winifred know how urgently we need to #StopBadRobocalls. Our state ranks 6th for the highest volume of robocalls. Enacting my bill, H.R. 3375, would give consumers the tools to end these spam calls! https://t.co/qXPPNWF5jn
Today is #WomensEqualityDay! On this day 99 years ago, women secured the right to vote—and made our democracy stronger. As we recognize the ratification of the 19th Amendment, let’s continue to fight for women’s full equality. #EqualityCantWait https://t.co/iknwXc8weV
Hoy y todos los días, es importante que todas las personas que viven en los Estados Unidos sepan que tienen ciertos derechos. Las #ICERaids del Presidente Trump están dirigidas a familias que contribuyen a comunidades y que merecen ser tratadas con dignidad. https://t.co/Xj4iVR6V49
Today and every day, it’s important to know that every individual living in the United States has certain rights. President Trump’s #ICERaids are targeting families who contribute to our communities – and who deserve to be treated with dignity. ICE must respect the rights of all. https://t.co/WIcDCQ76NZ
Last night, I attended the Cookie Cruise to benefit the Bob O’Connor Foundation. It was great to get everyone on board the Gateway Clipper—and on board to support this organization which does great work for our community development and charitable projects in #PGH. https://t.co/5TPATIVtyw
Today, I led a tour of Hawkins Village with Michelle Kenney, Antwon Rose’s mother. It's important that our government officials visit the neighborhood where Antwon lived and discuss the concerns that the residents of the community have. https://t.co/C9jDULnVI7
The wage gap has real consequences for black women. In 2017, black women earned 61 cents for every dollar earned by white, non-Hispanic male workers. On this Black Women’s Equal Pay Day, we must advocate for #equalpay protections and combat discriminatory pay. #PayBlackWomen https://t.co/hG8isvf0KK
Communities hurt by the epidemic of gun violence know it best - we cannot let another day pass without action to #EndGunViolence. It’s been 175 days since the House passed H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 to close dangerous loopholes. It’s time for the Senate to #DoSomething!
The Trump Administration is promoting discrimination by rolling back protections for LGBTQ Americans in our workforce. His repeated attempts to strip the rights of countless Americans are shameful and wrong.

America's 'what's it worth?' President guts #EndangeredSpeciesAct, guaranteeing extinction for more species and proving once again that @POTUS knows the price of everything but the value of nothing.

In order to combat climate change, we need to move toward a clean energy future and modernize our nation’s infrastructure - both of which will create good new jobs. I hope you’ll attend my upcoming town hall on climate change to learn more! https://t.co/860mYWS4Al

More than 5 million Pennsylvanians with pre-existing conditions would be at serious risk of losing health coverage without the #ACA – including those with Alzheimer’s, diabetes, heart disease, and multiple sclerosis – and we cannot let @POTUS sabotage it! #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/yElHpkGlpC
I joined 213 of my colleagues in demanding that Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell call the Senate back in session and #DoSomething about gun violence. The House passed H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 more than 160 days ago – it's time for the Senate to do the same! #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/FOZZJ1ijHa
I joined last night’s National Night Out Celebration with Primary Care Health Services and the National Association of Community Health Centers. This event brings the community together to learn about health services. It was great to see @RepGainey and constituents who attended. https://t.co/SYAjfgETxH
Across the world, people suffer from mental illness and play violent video games. Our nation alone is witnessing these terrible mass shootings so often. It’s past time for Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to #DoSomething to stop gun violence. https://t.co/jND4DpqmSq
I stand in solidarity and mourning with El Paso. This tragedy is not about video games or mental health - it’s about an epidemic of gun violence and the shameless rise of white nationalism. We have a national crisis, and we need the Senate to act NOW. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/o9s4Kv3vdd
On this day 54 years ago, President Johnson signed the #VotingRightsAct of 1965 and outlawed voting discrimination based on race. Today, we still face voter suppression in states and localities across the country. We must continue to fight for the voting rights of all Americans! https://t.co/VdBaxnQMww
In February, the House passed two bills that would close loopholes in our gun regulations and make our communities safer – H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112. For over FIVE MONTHS, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been SITTING on these bills. #EnoughIsEnough
My heart goes out to Dayton and El Paso. Thoughts and prayers are once again offered, but nothing else. One of these horrific acts a day was bad enough; how much worse will it have to get before we act? https://t.co/TmQcbuOMi2
Broadband access is a problem across PA, but especially in rural areas of our state. This is an equal access, economic opportunity, and security issue. People everywhere need affordable access if they want to participate in our economy and civic life.

Police officers can't keep our communities safe when they face crooks with concealable guns that can fire armor-piercing bullets. I’ve cosponsored the Law Enforcement Protection Act which would add such weapons to the National Firearms Act that regulates weapons like machineguns.

Our budget is a statement of priorities - and I want a budget that makes all Americans’ lives better. Today, the House is voting on a bipartisan bill to set federal budget levels for the next 2 years. I support this bill, which sets reasonable levels for important govt programs.
JUUL acts like they aren’t targeting young Americans and want to skate by the FDA and Congress without oversight. Misinforming young Americans about addiction and the role that e-cigarettes play is predatory and wrong, and JUUL must be held accountable. https://t.co/zcJxIA6tPV
Yesterday, the House came together to pass H.R. 3375, the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act by a vote of 429-3! This was a big step to help Americans avoid spam robocalls. Now, it’s up to the Senate to take the next step on behalf of the American people and #StopBadRobocalls! https://t.co/c32y1L9VE2

.@FTC failed to hold @Facebook accountable for deceiving billions of users about how it was using their data. I’m concerned that this settlement amounts to a slap on the wrist for FB that allows it to proceed without making the meaningful changes that would prevent future abuses.
Right – the Russia investigation wasn’t a hoax. It wasn’t a witch hunt. It was an honest investigation into a serious effort to undermine the foundations of our government by a hostile foreign government. https://t.co/5e9zEjPFfF
Mueller’s testimony reiterated and reinforced the report’s  findings of un-American, unethical actions by the Trump campaign. This was not a witch hunt. Congress must not take the Mueller report lightly. https://t.co/foHGUqWErG
After working hard and following the rules, retirees in #PGH shouldn’t be facing serious cuts in their pensions or scrambling to make ends meet. Today, the House is voting on H.R. 397, the #ButchLewis Act to help keep their pensions solvent. I’m a cosponsor, and I’m voting YES. https://t.co/WrvoTZEFeG
The House just voted to pass the #StopBadRobocalls Act! I introduced this bill with my @EnergyCommerce colleagues to give consumers tools to verify and block unwanted calls and give the FCC authority to enforce our laws against these calls. To the Senate!

Horse soring is cruel, and we must strengthen existing law with tougher enforcement and bigger penalties to ensure it comes to an end. That’s why I cosponsored the PAST Act - and why I am looking forward to voting for it. #PassthePASTAct
Pleased that the Senate has voted to #Renew911VCF. It’s our responsibility to support the heroes who stepped up that day, and this bill would permanently reauthorize funding to assist first-responders who are suffering from related medical issues.
https://t.co/X1AYFSOsOY
The Trump Administration’s actions will eliminate SNAP for 3 MILLION Americans desperate to put food on the table. By changing the way states determine SNAP eligibility, @POTUS is targeting seniors, children, and WORKING families who face food insecurity.
