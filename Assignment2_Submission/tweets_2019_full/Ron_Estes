I'm happy to champion legislation to protect the unborn &amp; the most vulnerable in our society. Individuals with Down syndrome enrich countless lives and communities and deserve the same protections and opportunities under federal law, beginning with the fundamental right to life.
As we recognize Down Syndrome Awareness Month, I have introduced the Down Syndrome Discrimination by Abortion Prohibition Act to place a federal ban on the performance of an abortion because an unborn child has been diagnosed with Down syndrome.

Since the day after the 2016 election, Democrats have vowed to impeach President Trump and have spent more than two years searching for a reason to do it. Instead of impeachment, Congress should focus on priorities like the USMCA and accomplishing results for the American people.
While the president has vowed to release a full transcript of his phone call with the leader of Ukraine, which I look forward to reviewing, I believe starting an impeachment inquiry today is irresponsible and will only succeed in further dividing the American people.
