Within the Democrats' first 100 days in the majority, they have:
- Ignored the crisis at the border
- Failed to present a budget
- Refused to denounce anti-Semitism
- Condoned infanticide

Democrats built the case on a fraudulent dossier that was paid for by Clinton supporters &amp; her campaign. It was an illegitimate investigation attempting an unprecedented result‚Äîremoval of a President. We now must work to restore public confidence &amp; trust in our legal system.
Over a year ago, the Republican-led House Select Committee on Intelligence conducted its own investigation and found no evidence of collusion. Yet Democrats persisted in claims that President Trump colluded with the Russians to steal the election. They are wrong.
Special Counsel Mueller‚Äôs investigation on potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election is finally over. After 22 months and $25 million expended, it proved nothing surprising or new.
