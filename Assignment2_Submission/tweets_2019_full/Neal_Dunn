It‚Äôs unconscionable that Speaker Pelosi is arbitrarily choosing to impeach the President w/o holding a single vote to do so. It‚Äôs un-American and flies in the face of the Constitution. I fully support President Trump‚Äôs decision and condemn Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs "impeachment by decree."
Speaker Pelosi‚Äôs partisan impeachment proceedings are a farce and an effort to overturn the 2016 election. Even worse, they will continue to stand in the way of Congress getting anything meaningful done for the foreseeable future.

If my Democrat colleagues are serious about pursuing wrongdoing, I would encourage them to look here. The American people have lost trust in the Justice Department and AG Barr is taking meaningful steps to ensure that it is restored.
Throughout this investigation there have been clear ethical violations that have put our national security at risk. AG Barr has stepped up during his short time as the head of the Justice Department and launched extensive investigations into the practices of the DOJ and the FBI.
AG Barr also confirmed the Special Counsel had full cooperation of the White House throughout his investigation. Unfortunately Dems will never be happy w/ the truth &amp; they have made it clear that they will continue to waste time &amp; resources until they create the result they want.
The House voted unanimously to release the report &amp; that is exactly what the AG has done. By working directly w/ Special Counsel on necessary redactions I believe he has more than fulfilled his promise &amp; it is time for Dems in Congress to end their witch hunt &amp; get back to work.
I commend Attorney General Barr for his timely release of the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs investigation and for his commitment to transparency for the American people. I look forward to reviewing the report over the coming days.
Recently, I was able to honor the life of Leon Arthur Bellot, Jr. a man who dedicated his life to serving others in Dixie County in the Congressional Record.
