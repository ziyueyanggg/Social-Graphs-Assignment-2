TONIGHT: I will be joining @LouDobbs to talk about House Republicans fighting for truth, transparency, and due process with the Democrats' unauthorized impeachment inquisition of @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. Watch @FoxBusiness at 7 EST.

From one witch-hunt to another, Democrats are eroding the fabric of our nation in an effort to take down @realDonaldTrump. If they have the evidence they claim to, why the secrecy? https://t.co/508XPpr58F

The @HouseDemocrats' lack of transparency throughout this process robs the American people of the chance to evaluate the credibility of each witness and the inquiry itself. The American people deserve better. https://t.co/t6osGZ5XLi

Our constituents want to see a Congress working for them- not one obsessed with attacking a president who we believe has not done anything to deserve impeachment. https://t.co/TQ0JHlA6x9
