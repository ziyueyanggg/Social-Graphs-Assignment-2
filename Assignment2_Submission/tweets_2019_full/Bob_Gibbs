Attempting to override the President’s veto is another way Congressional Democrats are perpetrating this problem in an effort to make it a campaign issue. The American people deserve a real fix for this urgent and deadly problem.
Republicans have offered solutions to secure the border, provide relief to a Border Patrol stretched thin, &amp; provide the humanitarian assistance that is essential to solving the crisis. Yet all the American people have seen is resistance, government shutdowns, and grandstanding.
We have a crisis at our border because Washington keeps kicking the can down the road, and Congressional Democrats tried to kick it a little further today. https://t.co/Gf509UPp3d

It is time the nation puts this spectacle behind us. Congressional Democrats should reconsider whether they want to drag this matter out after such a definitive conclusion from the Special Counsel.
I sincerely hope Congressional Democrats can finally accept that Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election despite the efforts by Andrew McCabe, James Comey, and others to smear Donald Trump.
The summary of the Special Counsel’s conclusions confirms what we knew all along: that neither the President nor anyone in his campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election. After two years and millions of dollars in taxpayer money, this witch hunt is finally over.

As a nation we are committed to ending the opioid crisis. Our first responders are the tip of the spear in those efforts. The HEROES Act will help local police, fire, &amp; EMTs stay alive as they keep our communities safe.

We are seeing first responders exposed to and experience overdose of illegal narcotics in the line of duty. Expanding availability of naloxone will help save lives.
The census citizenship question is not asking about legal status, only citizenship. It’s the same question the United Nations recommends nations ask in their census. @GOPoversight
The ACS asks respondents about their citizenship status and Democrats didn’t complain. Why are Democrats protesting now? We have the right to know how many citizens and non-citizens are in the US. @GOPoversight
