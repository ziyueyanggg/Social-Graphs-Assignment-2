This bill is not a silver bullet to end the youth vaping epidemic—which is why I have called for a ban on all e-cigarette products and comprehensive legislation to address the issue—but it is a good start. Now that it passed the House, I urge the Senate to take it up immediately.
With one in four high school students using e-cigarettes, and more vaping-related illnesses and deaths every day, it is long past time our government take on its moral responsibility to solve this problem.
There is broad, bipartisan agreement that kids should not be able to obtain dangerous e-cigarette products—whether in-person or online. That is why our bill closes loopholes that exempt online e-cigarette retailers from federal age verification requirements.
Today, the House took an important first step toward addressing the youth vaping epidemic by passing @RepArmstrongND's and my bill, the Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children Act. https://t.co/QIdUSpMjk1

On #WorldMentalHealthDay, we must continue the work to expand and guarantee access to affordable, quality mental healthcare, and Medicare for America will do just that.
And second, #Med4America also bans private contracting, which exacerbates barriers to mental healthcare. Currently, we have a two-tiered system where only the wealthy can afford care. #Med4America fixes that.
First, #Med4America gives mental health providers incentives to enter the pool. To increase care, we must increase the number of providers. Reimbursement rates are raised at least 30%, and our bill forgives 10% of student loan debt for each year the provider takes #Med4America.
Medicare for America would help solve this by guaranteeing universal, affordable, quality healthcare, and tearing down barriers to mental healthcare in two key ways. #MentalHealthAwarenessDay
Why so few? Too often, it is nearly impossible to find a mental health provider who accepts insurance. In a @NAMICommunicate survey, 1/3 of those seeking mental healthcare reported they could not find a single provider who took their insurance.

The Trump Administration needs to step back and reevaluate their priorities. Putting our food safety system at further risk will endanger people’s lives. No amount of additional corporate profit is worth that. I urge USDA to reverse course.
Food safety advocates certainly do not believe that. But industry lobbyists have a stranglehold on USDA, and they are rushing to implement these changes despite a flawed risk assessment analysis—which is currently the subject of an active OIG audit.
Under the guise of "modernizing" hog slaughter inspections, the Trump Administration will replace government inspectors with industry employees and allow for unlimited line speeds. Who actually believes these changes will make our food more safe?

California's landmark bill to reclassify contract workers as employees is an enormous step in unrigging the system on behalf of all workers and their families. Employee status is about a living wage, and benefits like unemployment insurance, health care and paid time off.

Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle need to recognize the lives President Trump has put at-risk due to his dangerous policies, and we must work to protect children as we appropriate funding for @HHSGov for the next fiscal year.
To this day, President Trump has turned @HHSGov into an immigration enforcement agency. That is wrong, and it is antithetical to the mission of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is to place children into sponsor’s care as safely and expeditiously as possible.
Meanwhile, some facilities were allowed to waive background checks and fingerprinting requirements for the workers that were tasked with caring for these children. That is unacceptable.
.@OIGatHHS also noted that this trauma was extended as kids languished in warehouse-like facilities for months on end due to additional Trump administration policies, such as fingerprinting everyone in a sponsor’s household.
These reports reinforce what we have known for over a year: that President Trump’s family separation policy was state-sanctioned child abuse. @OIGatHHS found that separating kids from their families inflicted unspeakable trauma on them. https://t.co/FAzdb6vWJi
