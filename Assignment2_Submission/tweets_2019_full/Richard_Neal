We must continue the fight to #LowerDrugCosts because American families should not have to choose between paying the bills or paying for medicine. Here's a recap of how @WaysMeansCmte has been addressing this important issue.

Today’s hearing is a very somber one, but also a very important one.  Hate is becoming mainstream in this country and that must end. I want to thank @repjohnlewis for holding this hearing.  You have spent your life working to eradicate hate, and I sincerely thank you for that.
Our Tax Code is also no place for hate.  Groups that propagate white supremacy, anti-Semitism, and hatred for the LGBTQ community, among others, do not deserve a government subsidy through tax exemption.  Hate is not charitable, and it is not educational.
We need to lead by example, and that requires us not only to reject, but to condemn outright, hate in all of its forms.  Racism, misogyny, xenophobia—they have no place here.  America is no place for hate.
As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to make this country stronger and to keep its people safe.  That includes a responsibility to do all we can to put an end to the senseless, hate-motivated violence that plagues our communities.  https://t.co/Cv4gpeLVfT

One of my top priorities in @WaysMeansCmte is to help workers of all ages prepare for a secure #retirement.
