There's no question which constitutional process he meant, and he said it for a reason.

That is why I renew my call for impeachment. Mueller made clear there is only one way to hold this president accountable, and nobody‚Äînot even the President‚Äîis above the law. [3/3]
3) if the Special Counsel‚Äôs office ‚Äúhad confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so‚Äù, and

4) ‚Äúthe Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting President of wrongdoing.‚Äù [2/3]
Robert Mueller‚Äôs statement today reiterated and confirmed four key points:

1) Attorney General Barr has knowingly misled the American people with his spin of the Special Counsel‚Äôs findings;

2) President Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúno collusion/no obstruction‚Äù mantra is patently false; [1/3]
