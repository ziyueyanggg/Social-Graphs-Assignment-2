We need to bring our laws into the 21st century &amp; put people back in control of their personal data, because who knows where the internet will take us in another 50 years! That‚Äôs why I introduced the Information Transparency &amp; Personal Data Control Act.
The most recent email privacy laws date back to the 1980‚Äôs, meaning there are more protections for letters in filing cabinets than emails in the cloud.
Now, 4.33 billion people are active internet users ‚Äì 56% of the global population ‚Äì and the internet does far more than it did 50 years ago. However, our laws regulating the internet are extremely outdated.
On Oct. 29th, 1969, Charles Kline sent some basic text from UCLA to the Stanford Research Institute via computer using a program called the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). This was the start of the internet.
Since it‚Äôs the internet‚Äôs 50th birthday, let‚Äôs look back at how far we have come since its invention! *A Thread üëá*

Nancy from Kirkland in #WA01 is narcoleptic and requires medication, but her prescription jumps in price every 6 months. How can she possibly budget for that? The #LowerDrugCosts Now Act would make sure drug companies are held accountable for drug cost spikes.
