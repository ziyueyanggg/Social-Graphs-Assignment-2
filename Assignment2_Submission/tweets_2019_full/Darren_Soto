This is larger than politics, and our actions cannot depend on whether the Senate Republicans will eventually put country over party.

We took an oath to uphold the constitution, and that is a solemn and sacred obligation. https://t.co/xELGuCi9BO

This is in addition to other matters already subject to #impeachmentinquiry: obstruction of justice, emoluments (bribery) violations, and elections hush money.
Pres Trump admitted to asking a foreign power to help his re-election. He then tried to cover it up by refusing to disclose the whistleblower. These are blatant violations of our laws and betrayal to our country. #ImpeachmentInquiry will begin immediately! https://t.co/kJ9SlIctPs
@carloescalona4 The county actually handles that type of issue. We will pass it along to them thanks!
Very honored to speak with bright students at @valenciacollege Lake Nona about bipartisanship, student loan reform, protecting our environment, and more high paying high tech jobs for the district! https://t.co/gT8txQSYHN

Time for Trump Admin to stop sabotaging the Public Service Debt Forgiveness Program. Many young people went into public service in reliance of this program to eliminate their #studentloans and they deserve justice! https://t.co/sxiAzQOS6i
