I would like to thank @WhiteHouse for sending me their talking points on how best to spin the disastrous Trump/Zelensky call in Trump‚Äôs favor. However, I will not be using their spin and will instead stick with the truth.

I want to thank my colleagues from districts Trump won who have come out for impeachment. They know it‚Äôs  a big political risk they‚Äôre taking. But they‚Äôre doing it anyway because they think it‚Äôs the right thing to do. They are profiles in courage.

I represent more Ukrainian-Americans than any other member of Congress. I‚Äôve introduced more bills and amendments supporting Ukraine than any other member. What Trump has done is sacrifice America‚Äôs defense of Europe against Russia. It is deeply unpatriotic. He must be impeached.
