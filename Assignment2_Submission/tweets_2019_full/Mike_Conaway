The Democrats‚Äô obsession with impeachment has halted all normal legislative business. Congress is unable to perform our basic duties of appropriations, funding the military, and passing the #USMCA. The American people deserve better. It is time to get back to work.
The Democrats‚Äô obsession with impeachment is not just a political distraction, it is harming the American people.
There are only 21 legislative days left on the House calendar for this year. Congress has yet to:
‚Ä¢Fund the government and our military
‚Ä¢Ratify the #USMCA
‚Ä¢Secure the border and fix our broken immigration system

It is one thing for the Chinese Communist government to manipulate the lives of our farmers and ranchers for their political gain. It is another thing entirely for the United States Congress to do that to our own citizens.
CCC funding, which rural America depends on, will now be a political weapon, used by both sides moving forward, at the expense of America‚Äôs farmers and ranchers.
From today‚Äôs @HouseAgGOP hearing: It is shameful that Democrats have chosen to use farmers and ranchers as leverage simply because they don‚Äôt like this president.
