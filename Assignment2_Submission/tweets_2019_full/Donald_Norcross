üîüTrump's changing behavior toward Michael Cohen.

The Mueller report described how Trump‚Äôs conduct toward Cohen, a fmr Trump Org exec, changed from praise to castigation after Cohen began cooperating with prosecutors.
9‚É£Trump pressuring possible witnesses, including Flynn &amp; Manafort.

Trump‚Äôs team asked fmr national security adviser Michael Flynn for a ‚Äúheads up‚Äù on information &amp; commended fmr campaign manager Paul Manafort for not ‚Äúflipping."
8‚É£Trump trying to get Sessions to take back control of the Mueller investigation.

The Mueller report says there‚Äôs evidence that one purpose of Trump asking Sessions to stop being recused between July-Dec 2017 was so Sessions would restrict the scope of the investigation.
7‚É£Trump trying to have Sessions curtail the Mueller investigation.

Trump told adviser Corey Lewandowski to have then-AG Sessions publicly announce the Mueller investigation was ‚Äúvery unfair‚Äù &amp; have Sessions tell Mueller to limit future investigations in election meddling.
6‚É£Trump trying to stop then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions from recusing himself from the Russia investigation in the first place.
5‚É£Trump telling McGahn to deny that he had wanted Mueller removed.

Trump told then-WH counsel McGahn to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù a New York Times story that reported Trump had earlier instructed McGahn to fire special counsel Mueller.
4‚É£Trump attempting to stop the public from seeing evidence.

Trump directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails that set up the Trump Tower meeting (involving Russia providing information on Hillary Clinton) &amp; Trump edited a related press statement for Donald Trump Jr.
3‚É£Trump trying to remove Special Counsel Mueller after he was appointed.

Trump reacted to news of Mueller‚Äôs appointment by telling advisers that it was ‚Äúthe end of his presidency.‚Äù Trump even called then-WH counsel McGahn &amp; directed him to have Mueller removed. McGahn refused.
2‚É£The firing of FBI Director James Comey.

The Mueller report says ‚Äúsubstantial evidence‚Äù indicates Trump‚Äôs decision to fire was the result of Comey's unwillingness to say publicly that Trump was not personally under investigation.
1‚É£Trump pressuring then-FBI Director James Comey to end the probe of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
