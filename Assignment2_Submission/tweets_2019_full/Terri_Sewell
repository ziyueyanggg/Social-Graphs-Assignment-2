In this country, the history of lynching is one of white supremacy, humiliation and dehumanization.

For the people of Alabama's 7th Congressional District, who marched, bled &amp; died to end this type of terrorism, the sting of the President’s words is especially sharp.
From Reconstruction to the Civil Rights Movement, 3,446 African Americans were murdered by lynching.

On August 26, 1920, the 19th Amendment was fully ratified and added to U.S. Constitution, forever protecting American women’s right to vote. 99 years later, I'm proud to be part of the largest group of women to ever serve in the U.S. Congress! #WomensEqualityDay https://t.co/9B6hH4PLaH
On this day in 1956 the home of Pastor Graetz, a supporter of integration, was bombed in MTG while he attended an integration workshop in Tennessee. Remembering our past in all it’s ugliness and complexity allows us to build toward a better future. https://t.co/YlYAnVxjB9

Can you believe today is #BlackWomensEqualPayDay? That means today marks how far into 2019 black women on average have to work just to make what white men made in 2018! It’s past time to close the pay gap and ensure women receive #equalpay for equal work! https://t.co/TVZC6txizY
Grieving is a necessary part of healing. Please join the friends &amp; family of Jacquez Hall this evening in Bessemer to grieve life lost and to reflect on how we, as a community, can move forward together without violence.

Storytelling is magic. It has the power to entertain, heal trauma &amp; teach empathy. I'm especially excited about the Bham @sidewalkfilm “Black Lens track” that uplifts filmmakers of color. Sharing stories helps us to bridge our divides and build compassion.

We must recommit to eradicating white supremacy in all forms. There were not good people on both sides.
Two years ago, neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville, Va and killed Heather Heyer and state troopers Jay Cullen and Berke Bates. 

Today, white supremacists, some emboldened by the President’s dangerous rhetoric, continue to threaten our communities and the American way of life.

Now, we mourn with Dayton, OH for the tragic &amp; senseless shooting within 13 hours of the El Paso mass shooting. No more mourning, we need ACTION! House Dems passed 2 bills this Congress for universal gun background check. Now is the time for Mitch &amp; Senate GOP to pass the laws!
The news out of El Paso today is devastating and my heart breaks for all those impacted by the shooting, especially the families who lost loved ones. 

How many more Americans will be killed before the GOP will take action to end our nation’s gun violence epidemic?
