It's heartbreaking to witness the ongoing devastation caused by gun violence. @senatemajldr continues to ignore the cries for change. It's time to bring up #HR8 for a vote and #DoSomething #EndGunViolence https://t.co/JTOueO9TM4
Diverting funds from military projects for a senseless wall is reckless and irresponsible. It puts our national security, and our men and women in uniform at risk. We must come together to stop this.

More than 90% of the American public supports background checks for all gun sales, yet a dangerous and deadly loophole in federal gun laws exempts unlicensed sellers from having to perform any background check whatsoever before selling a firearm. @senatemajldr#DoSomething https://t.co/SqGO4cArbp

Great meeting yesterday with @RepJoeCourtney and leaders from labor unions on the importance of traditional apprenticeship programs to train employees. We cannot water down training and undercut worker pay like the Trump Administration is suggesting. https://t.co/Jh2NhXjvL1

Our nation’s high rate of gun violence can be reduced, but first we need to strengthen our laws and close the loopholes that allow deadly weapons to end up in the wrong hands.  @senatemajldr and the @SenateGOP can #DoSomething to address this by taking up #HR8 #EndGunViolence https://t.co/HtqHVfQFyO
99 years ago the 19th amendment was adopted into the U.S constitution, finally giving women the right to vote. While we've made a lot of progress since then, we must continue to commit to fight for the full equality women deserve. #WomensEqualityDay https://t.co/gK5v7pH6Ya

Congress has an obligation to protect the American people and stop the gun violence epidemic that’s ravaging our communities. For 177 days @SenateGOP has  blocked House-passed bills to #EndGunViolence. My message to @senatemajldr is simple: #DoSomething. https://t.co/Z2LhuqdtIX
#DidYouKnow Black women were paid 61 cents for every dollar paid to white non-Hispanic male workers in 2017. To make matters worse, the pay gap results in lower Social Security benefits for Black women. It’s time to #PayBlackWomen https://t.co/fvI2HE9lDR

We should be encouraging open and direct dialogue, not preventing it. @RepRashida and @Ilhan are duly elected Members of Congress, who shouldn't be shut out of any conversation. This is a big mistake. I urge @IsraeliPM to allow Reps. Tlaib &amp; Omar visit.
