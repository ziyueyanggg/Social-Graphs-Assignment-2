Over the last ten years, population and inflation have increased a combined 26 percent. Revenues have more than kept pace, increasing 29 percent. The problem is the third number. Spending has grown 46 percent.  https://t.co/IWBgT792cf  https://t.co/SA92Zv67xO
Curbing spending is the only way to control our deficits and ballooning debt.  Without resolute action now, we run the risk of an unstoppable debt spiral and ultimately a sovereign debt crisis. The RSC budget points the way back to solvency and prosperity. https://t.co/zVDdL6LFvu
