‚úÖDeploy those new technologies ASAP.

Here‚Äôs my plan to do all three: https://t.co/Wb7NHzTRtl

Every witness at our #ClimateCrisis hearing today agreed: The technology we need to cut our greenhouse gas emissions already exists and is already commercially available.

BREAKING: For anyone doubting how serious, and scary, the Trump admin‚Äôs new ‚Äúexpedited removal‚Äù rule is for ALL OF US, see below. This is the official announcement from the admin: ‚Äúanywhere in the country ‚Ä¶ sole and unreviewable discretion ‚Ä¶‚Äù This is not OK and must be stopped. https://t.co/ghnE4bCEQj https://t.co/z5OA0a1pjN
Guides &amp; outfitters are the heart &amp; soul of our outdoor recreation industry, but an overly complicated permit process can prevent them from operating on federal lands. I just filed new legislation to streamline the process, while still protecting the land &amp; prioritizing safety. https://t.co/3Vjd3Epa4R
The Trump admin‚Äôs new ‚Äúexpedited removal‚Äù rule should terrify us all. It will allow ICE officers to approach ANYBODY in the U.S. (w/o probable cause) &amp; demand they prove they‚Äôre a citizen or have been in the US for 2 years. If they can‚Äôt, they‚Äôre deported. No trial, no hearing.

I just finished visiting the ICE facility in Aurora. This is not the way we should be treating people. We saw 48 women in what looked like a crowded gym. One of them had been there for 1.5 years. We shouldn‚Äôt have private detention facilities in the US. We need to close them now. https://t.co/D6uJUe6hnN
Walking into the ICE detention facility in Aurora, Colorado now. A recent DHS IG report found detainees here were not being properly cared for. ICE claims it has taken steps to correct the issues. I‚Äôm returning here today to see that for myself. Stay tuned.
Today, we are reminded of the greatness that our country can achieve when we work together. #GoForTheMoon #Apollo11at50 https://t.co/0HY3gCx2w8
Some moments in life you never forget. I still remember the anxiety &amp; anticipation I felt sitting with my family &amp; watching #Apollo11 land on the moon for the 1st time. We were so worried something might go wrong, only to be calmed by the strength &amp; steadiness of our astronauts.
A new study shows that the Trump admin‚Äôs plan to open more of Colorado‚Äôs public lands to oil &amp; gas drilling will greatly increase greenhouse gas emissions &amp; further exacerbate the ongoing #climatecrisis. If we‚Äôre going to solve this crisis, this reckless plan must be stopped. https://t.co/BMk0YgPSRg

BIG NEWS: The House just voted to increase the federal minimum wage to $15/hr. There‚Äôs no place in America where a full-time worker making $7.25 an hour can make ends meet. This bill will give millions of American workers a much-needed (&amp; long overdue) boost in pay. #RaiseTheWage
Today‚Äôs vote should send a clear message that ignoring Congressional subpoenas will not be tolerated. Congress has a duty to oversee this administration. The American people are relying on us to hold this administration accountable and we will continue to do exactly that.
BREAKING: The House just voted to hold Sec. Wilbur Ross &amp; AG William Barr in criminal contempt for refusing to comply with our subpoenas seeking information on the Trump administration‚Äôs plan to rig elections in the GOP‚Äôs favor by adding a citizenship question to the #2020Census.
I just voted NO on killing the resolution to impeach Donald Trump.

Enough is enough.

Whether it‚Äôs the facts laid out in the Mueller report or his recent racist remarks, the American people deserve better.

The time to move forward is now.

Alex Acosta‚Äôs decision years ago to turn his back on dozens of young girls is inexcusable. His unwillingness to stand up for these young victims raised serious doubts about his willingness to stand up for the American people now. He finally did the right thing by stepping down.
We know the president hasn‚Äôt given up on the GOP‚Äôs plan to rig our future elections. While it‚Äôs not entirely clear how this new order will work, it‚Äôs important that we remain hypervigilant about what it means and how it could be used to impact our democracy. https://t.co/QJ88zFcMMt

Migrants are being told to drink out of toilets, separated from their families, and locked in cages like cattle, yet the President has the audacity to say they "are living far better now than where they came from"?!

BREAKING: A new report from the DHS Inspector General shows HORRIFIC conditions at detention centers. Migrants are stuck in cages w/ standing room only, lack proper food, &amp; haven't showered in weeks. This includes thousands of kids. This is unacceptable. We must end this cruelty.
President Trump announced ICE raids will begin after July 4th. Instilling fear in the hearts of families across the country is not who we are as a country. We should be doing everything we can to help these immigrants, not tearing families apart.

In a win for repro rights, SCOTUS announced that it won‚Äôt review a lower court‚Äôs decision to block Alabama‚Äôs abortion ban. This law was an egregious attack on women‚Äôs rights, and today‚Äôs decision should send a clear message to other states that similar bans will not be tolerated.
The Senate‚Äôs bill, on the other hand, does nothing to protect these children. 

Congress has a responsibility to protect these kids, and if that requires us to stay in town to hash this out and get it right, then that‚Äôs what we should be doing.
The bill we passed earlier in the House this week would not only provide the agencies caring for these children the resources they need, it would also set strict new standards to ensure these kids are receiving the care they deserve.
I can't support a bill that gives our agencies all the money they need to house these migrant kids, but does nothing to ensure they are properly cared for. Congress has a responsibility to protect these kids. I voted against the bill Congress passed today b/c it doesn‚Äôt do that.
