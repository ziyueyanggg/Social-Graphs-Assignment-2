I offered a Motion to Recommit that would delay the implementation of HR 1373 until the Sec of Interior issues a report concluding this permanent withdrawal of lands from mineral development will not increase US imports of critical minerals from countries hostile to US interests. https://t.co/qRSLgaYiju
We shouldn't allow our adversaries to dominate the mining, production and markets of these resources. If we do, we weaken our position &amp; are subject to increased economic &amp; military pressure from Beijing and Moscow. Unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues voted down my #MTR.
Today House Ds voted to approve a bill that could negatively impact our national and energy security. HR 1373 aims to permanently prohibit mining of rare earths &amp; critical minerals on 1,000,000 acres of public land, increasing our dependence on imported foreign sources of uranium
Uranium is essential to both our national and energy security. It supplies many critical military technologies and fuels our domestic nuclear reactors - which provide 20 percent of our nation’s electricity.
Had a great time packing care packages today with @the_USO for our troops overseas. As we approach veterans day, it is great to remember all those who have served our nation in uniform, both active duty and retired. https://t.co/xJxbdrBAH9

Bc of the ceasefire negotiated by VP Pence, the bill allows for waivers to many of the sanctions to give the ceasefire a chance to hold + reinforces POTUS' declaration should Turkey violate the ceasefire, strong sanctions will be enacted. We must maintain stability in the region.
I just voted in favor of the PACT Act that will impose sanctions on Turkey – prohibiting the transfer of US defense articles to Turkey for use in Syria and banning senior Turkish officials involved in the violence against the Kurds from entering the US.
Last night I was proud to support the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act. This bill promotes education &amp; research in palliative care &amp; hospice, and supports the development of faculty careers in academic palliative medicine. Glad to see this moving forward.

I had the opportunity to work with Governor Baliles, and he was a true Virginia statesman. Although he is no longer with us, his legacy lives on in many ways. I send my sincerest condolences to his family and friends during this difficult time.
I was saddened to hear today of the passing of former Governor of Virginia, Gerald Baliles. Gov. Baliles fought hard for transportation and environmental initiatives that have benefited VA for the decades that followed his tenure.
The legislation enables the expenditure of approximately $34 billion over the next decade, which will allow the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to dredge all Federal harbors to their constructed widths and depths – including the Port of Virginia.
Yesterday, the Full Utilization of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Act passed the House with my strong support. This bill would unlock billions in fees to maintain federally authorized harbors.

That's why I support the Honest Elections Act. The Honest Elections Act actually targets foreign actors to prevent meddling in our elections &amp; modernizes our laws for the 21st Century.
Today, Democratic Leadership brought the SHIELD Act up for a vote. This bill, which passed with exclusively Dem support, does not protect the American people or our elections. It only serves to federalize the election process.
Great meeting today with @NASA_Langley Director Clay Turner.

Our job as Members of Congress is to do the work of the people. We owe it to the American people to hold ourselves to the highest standards, and unfortunately, this impeachment process has been held in a secretive and partisan manner.

ISIS remains a threat to the US and the West, and the consequences of this will be lasting for the Middle East and the rest of the world. I believe that Congress must be willing to act to limit the catastrophic impact of this decision, which could potentially include sanctions.
We must continue to support our partners in times of need. These aggressive actions by Turkey threaten to halt momentum against ISIS, and they should stop immediately.

The measure of success as Congress provides resources for national defense is not in the number of platforms, but in the overwhelming capability the U.S. military brings to deter and, if necessary, to win decisively against any adversary.
His strategy will impact how the naval services interact with each other and will require real buy-in from the industrial base and Congress. This cannot be a one-foot-in-one-foot-out process. Check out my latest in War on the Rocks for more: https://t.co/jJAcmnjINw

Sound science is the proper foundation for accessing the nature of America’s offshore energy reserves. Knowledge is critical if we are to even consider developing offshore oil and natl gas–in the process creating jobs, generating economic growth + increasing our energy security.
I am not advocating that we start production before we have all the necessary information to make a sound decision, but I believe we must be willing to do the exploration and assessment of available resources in order to have the full scope of information.
I voted against HR 1941 today as it makes us strategically weaker as a nation. Banning US energy development will only increase our dependence on foreign oil and natural gas. We have the ability to achieve energy security by safely and responsibly developing our resources here.

Thanks to everyone who came out this morning to my First District CTE Task Force Meeting this morning in Woodbridge as we talked about preparing area students for careers of the future. It was a great success! https://t.co/n9wU2LlKBg
This article makes some fantastic points on the effectiveness of our carriers, and I will continue to support our fighting men and women and the platforms they need to complete their missions.

I spent the afternoon at a roundtable with American Shipbuilding Suppliers Assn at the VA Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Center @ODU. These are exciting times as DoD's desire for innovation continues to grow, and I will continue to support stable funding from Congress. https://t.co/kKAJhscwWe
Had a great morning opening the Conference of the Virginia Commissioners of the Revenue Association in Williamsburg! They serve as invaluable resources for the citizens of Virginia's First District, and I cannot thank them enough for the hard work they do every day. https://t.co/XAEDmlHCB4
The time to prepare for a hurricane is now. Make sure you #KnowYourZone, have an emergency plan ready, and are supplied with a weather radio, water, food, and other essentials. https://t.co/hR4beAFsdC
I am hosting these seminars to provide an important opportunity for localities to learn the resources available to them, to make broadband access a reality for these communities.
Demand for high speed broadband has never been greater; closing the #digitaldivide is the key to lifting up countless communities and populations in unserved areas.
For me, the issue of rural broadband dates back more than 20 years to my time on Westmoreland County Board of Supervisors.
Today I held my 2nd Community Broadband Field Seminar in Lancaster County as an opportunity for underserved and unserved communities within the area to learn more about the funding and resources available at the state and federal levels to help bring broadband to their citizens.
I was honored to be a part of this celebration last week. Projects like these keep our communities thriving, and I will continue to support funding for quality of life improvements like this.

There is absolutely no room for such hate in our community and this does not reflect the values of Virginians.

When the House recessed at the end of July for six long weeks out of Washington, our to-do list was long. Now, we are two weeks from the start of the September legislative session and we still have a lot to do.
I am ready to be back in Washington solving the problems facing the American people, and I will continue to hold my colleagues accountable to the people we represent.
Check out these great photos from around the Northern Neck! Our area boasts so many great outdoor locations that folks can get out and enjoy, so make sure you take advantage this summer! How many places can you recognize? https://t.co/wqOl9UFSRb
Wages are rising, small business optimism is climbing, and unemployment is at near historic lows. Our economy continues to thrive thanks to commonsense policies I have supported in Washington. I will continue to promote pro-growth legislation for the people of Virginia. https://t.co/L0Te5s711J
I was proud to support this legislation to end the retirement income crisis by establishing retirement plans for working individuals of all ages. These changes will create a more accessible retirement system for Americans. Learn more here:

I will continue fighting for patient-provider centered reforms that expand choices for consumers, increase access to care, reduce health care costs, and enhance transparency in our healthcare system.
https://t.co/mG8R7VSRKw
We need a patient-centered system that favors quality, choice, and empowers individuals and families to make decisions for themselves based on what best fits their needs, wants, and budget.
Here are just a few of the effects of Medicare for All:

- Higher taxes for Americans 💵
- Higher taxes for businesses 💰
- Lower wages for doctors 👩‍⚕️
- Funding cuts to hospitals 🏥

That is untenable.
Serving in the Virginia House of Delegates and now serving in Congress, the 400th-anniversary celebration allowed me to reflect on our rich history in Virginia and the role we played in determining what it means to be an American. Read more here: https://t.co/xiIrKyu3tY
I had the incredible honor to attend the 400th Anniversary Celebration of Representative Democracy in the New World at the end of last month. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reflect upon the four centuries of history that has brought us the freedoms we hold dear today.
Educators can also access information on professional learning opportunities, Career and Technical Education development, and much more for both teachers and administrators here: https://t.co/38W3X7FV7p
Similarly, they offer SOL practice items, driver’s education information, and college prep material for students here: https://t.co/9z7gPw9cQG
As a parent, access to information regarding your child’s education is important, and VDoE offers several great resources such as graduation requirements, school nutrition programs, special education and more information for families here: https://t.co/sCtVRJK2aE
As the school year starts for many students across Virginia very soon, there are some important resources available to students, teachers, and parents through the Virginia Department of Education. @VDOE_News
50 years ago today, VA was ravaged by Hurricane Camille. It wasn’t the winds or storm surge that affected hundreds of Virginians, but the incredible rainfall and flooding that impacted the Commonwealth. A stark reminder to prepare this hurricane season.
https://t.co/gs59XHFhUE
We are right in the middle of hurricane season. Are you prepared? Be informed by knowing what to do before, during, and after an emergency, and create a family emergency plan. The time to prepare is now. https://t.co/POKEQJ6T4Y
On this day 74 years ago, WWII ended with the surrender of the Imperial Japanese Forces. I hope you take a moment today to remember the service of all who fought for the freedoms we enjoy today. I will continue to fight for those who fought for us. https://t.co/xhAKNtQ3wE
The Port of Virginia is a national gateway for commerce, supporting businesses in all the lower 48 states and handling record-setting cargo volumes that are driving its expansion. Read more in my latest from The Hill:

Last week, the Guard of Honor jumped into Stafford as part of a training exercise. This is a great reminder of important role Virginia plays in the defense of our nation. I will continue to advocate for the resources our warfighters and veterans deserve.

Once again, more strong numbers for small business optimism. Our nation’s small businesses are the backbone of our local economy, and I will continue to support measures in Congress to rollback unnecessary burdens and promote strong growth.

I was so grateful to play a small part in helping the Soles family to honor the memory of Gloucester native George B. Soles more than 70 years after his heroic service in World War II. This is such a great story of service, humility, and honor. https://t.co/OS2rXHYxed
I had such a great time earlier this week with Healthy Harvest Food Bank as we spent the morning gleaning on the Northern Neck. I was glad to be a part of their mission to help others here in our area! https://t.co/dU4MVlx8PD
I believe in a better healthcare future for Virginians and I will continue fighting for patient-provider centered reforms that expand choices for consumers, increase access to care, reduce healthcare costs, and enhance transparency in our healthcare system.
It is clear: a majority of Americans believe it is more important to improve our current system to enhance quality and lower costs instead of creating a government-run plan.
https://t.co/Thr16ZgSNL
Medicare for All means less access to care for folks throughout the country, especially in rural areas. That is something I cannot in good conscience support for folks across our Commonwealth and nation. https://t.co/px9ji2bSOi
The goal of healthcare reform must be to drive costs down so that quality health care is affordable and accessible to all Americans. We must enact meaningful reforms that put the patient and provider back at the center of our healthcare system. Medicare for All is not the answer.
In case you missed this article in the Daily Press on Wednesday, I wanted to make sure you saw it. Expanding access to high-speed internet is critical to economic development and growth in our nation. Read more here:

Six months ago today, the #BornAliveAct was introduced. For six months, Speaker Pelosi and Democratic leadership has blocked a vote on this critical issue. That is unacceptable. No matter the obstacles, I will work tirelessly to #EndInfanticide. https://t.co/fFv31iUA1t
My heart breaks for all those affected by these senseless tragedies. I commend the work of the first responders involved and will continue to work to end these acts of violence.
The innovative work done by #VA01 constituents at NSWC Dahlgren is a critical complement to everything our Combatant Commanders do, and it will continue to be a game-changer in our countries’ national defense for generations to come. #Dahlgren
In #VA01 national priorities are local priorities, and I am so proud to represent the thousands of federal employees and military personnel who work at NSWC Dahlgren. @NSWCDD @NSASP1
This is exactly what I fight for every day in Congress as a member of the House Armed Services Committee.

More great economic news! Our economy continues to thrive thanks to commonsense measures to roll back burdensome regulations and encourage small business optimism. I will continue to support pro-growth legislation to benefit the people of the Commonwealth!

Great to attend the Fredericksburg Transportation Summit this morning to discuss transportation issues in the Fredericksburg area: congestion, access to commuter rail, and crumbling roads and bridges, just to name a few. Thanks to all who came out! https://t.co/cCYsaeTYr2
This long history of putting community and country before self is still strong here in Virginia. It inspires not only us but has inspired those who have come before us and will inspire our next generation of leaders. https://t.co/QaYwPA0WDS
My time in the General Assembly was one of the most rewarding highlights of my career. Those who came before me shaped our history by putting their neighbors and countrymen first. That task came then to me and my colleagues, and one day would pass on to many more. https://t.co/jjJwjSGKd6
It was an honor to participate in this important day yesterday at #Jamestown and to be a part of this incredible celebration of four hundred years of Democracy in America. https://t.co/nlN3LWYCYX
It was such an honor to attend the 400th Anniversary celebrations in #Jamestown this morning with @POTUS. As a lifelong public servant and a direct descendant of the first legislative body, I feel a strong sense of gratitude for the events today. #Democracy400 @Commemorate2019
.@RealDonaldTrump, the “liberty, democracy, and self-rule” to which you paid such tribute traces its roots here, to this place. It was here, in a little church, in a tiny fort, in a struggling colony that the light of liberty was first lit on these American shores. #Democracy400
