Today is the anniversary of the March on Washington in 1963, when Dr. King told the nation ‚ÄúI have a Dream‚Äù. Today is also the anniversary of the murder of Emmett Till in 1955. This is the duality of America: loss and hope; pain and persistence; failure and potential.

A Majority of Americans support #equalpay regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic level. Yet, over and over again, we see that Black women continue to face pay disparity ‚Äì no matter their career, industry, or education level. #BlackWomensEqualPay https://t.co/RP56q502gc
The U.S. has the worst maternal mortality rate in the developed world, and Texas has one of the worst rates in the country. Today @RepColinAllred and I are announcing new legislation to do something about it ‚Äì and to make life easier for newborn infants and their parents. https://t.co/nyt7y503os
RIP Celso Pi√±a ‚Äì a true musical giant who brought so much joy to communities around the world and here in North Texas. Descansa en paz, rebelde del acorde√≥n. https://t.co/ZLHM3ArKDQ
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong ‚Äì this is coming from the guy who just told members of Congress to ‚Äúgo back where they came from‚Äù, called Mexicans ‚Äúrapists‚Äù, and labeled African nations ‚Äús***hole countries‚Äù?

Implying Jewish Americans are ‚Äúdisloyal‚Äù is among the most revolting tropes of Antisemitism. I stand with the Jewish community in condemning this offensive remark ‚Äì it‚Äôs up to all of us to fight against Antisemitism wherever it rears its ugly head.

The President needs to step outside the echo chamber of his own rallies and listen to the majority of Americans: it‚Äôs time for common sense gun reforms like universal background checks. https://t.co/AfjY4TEn1f
It‚Äôs the First Day of School for many of our Metroplex students! Encouraging all our #TX33 students to study hard ‚Äì a good education is the surest ticket to a fulfilling life. I‚Äôll continue to work in Congress to support our students, teachers, and schools! https://t.co/SwFr333JA1
Fantastic to meet with Destiny Vasquez of Oak Cliff, an @ATT intern. I‚Äôm thankful that AT&amp;T is offering these paid internships to young people across #TX33! https://t.co/ZEXDPB1Och
Another great town hall last night in Fort Worth! I‚Äôm thankful to everyone who came out and express their concerns and opinions. Participation is what makes our democracy work. #TX33 https://t.co/LOASUj6Zjv
Don‚Äôt forget, I‚Äôm having a Town Hall in Fort Worth TONIGHT. I want to hear directly from you on the issues facing our community. Hope you to see you there! https://t.co/oh9EREQFtA
I‚Äôm a strong supporter of Israel and fierce opponent of anti-Semitism‚Äì that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so concerned that President Trump is conflating support for Israel with his bigotry against Immigrants, Muslims, and Americans of color. Nothing could be worse for Israel‚Äôs long-term interests.
Representatives Omar and Tlaib are duly elected members of Congress and should be respected as such. https://t.co/C9O9bughfw
Over 800,000 Dreamers have been able to legally work, go to college, and pursue the American Dream thanks to #DACA - including over 20,000 in the DFW metroplex alone. America is their home. They deserve the right to stay. We must #ProtectTheDream. https://t.co/3w9JUeiR2h
Listen to this man. It‚Äôs time for common-sense gun reforms. @senatemajldr, give #HR8 and #HR1112 a vote. https://t.co/hz2AJ6vL0o

84 years ago, FDR signed the Social Security Act of 1935 into law. Today, this law provides lifesaving benefits to millions of Americans and their families. We need to protect Americans‚Äô Social Security benefits, not cut them. #SocialSecurity84 https://t.co/fzYMiOKdRC
We want to change our immigration policy so it aligns with our values.

Two years ago, our nation witnessed an outbreak of white supremacist hatred and violence in Charlottesville. Two years later, after attacks in other communities such as Pittsburgh and El Paso, we must continue to confront the hateful and un-American ideology of white supremacy.
The Endangered Species Act saved some of our most iconic American species such as the Bald Eagle and Grizzly Bear from extinction. Now it‚Äôs under unprecedented attack by the Trump administration. RT to urge @SecBernhardt to reverse course! #StopExtinction https://t.co/F0PSZIb1p7
I joined some of the employees at Lear Corporation yesterday to visit their new plant in Grand Prairie. Glad to see the all the great things these guys are doing for business in #TX33! https://t.co/Vz2spXHYPo

@RepKayGranger @RepRonWright As a representative from the DFW Metroplex, I know that our community is the ideal location to honor our nation‚Äôs veterans and their service to our country.
I‚Äôm proud to join @RepKayGranger and @RepRonWright in leading our fellow Texans to support the city of Arlington, Texas for the future home of the National Medal of Honor Museum. https://t.co/nNOrxaI0dc
The House passed #HR8 and #HR1112‚Äîbipartisan bills that will protect our communities from gun violence‚Äîover 160 days ago. Yet the Senate refuses to take action on our legislation. 

Watch my interview w/ @cbs11jack to discuss why they need to step up and #DoSomething. https://t.co/njjRYcbGg2
#ICE should prioritize the deportation of criminals and those who pose a high national security risk, not those who are following the law and working to make a better life for their families. We have got to do better than this.
Hundreds of kids went to sleep without their parents last night and today they are waking up not knowing when they will see them again. https://t.co/QhGLcunrpp
Today, I had the privilege to welcome back and kick off the upcoming school year with the hardworking teachers of the Everman Independent School District in Tarrant County. Thank you all for your service! https://t.co/rVCMKzJfTR

President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law 54 years ago today. It's time for Congress to work together to fully #RestoreTheVOTE and pass legislation to modernize our democracy. #VRA54 https://t.co/AyEGfZSCiC
America must stand together to stop this hatred and keep our communities safe.
29 innocent lives were lost in less than 24 hours in acts of domestic terrorism across America just this weekend. The hate and vitriol that our President spews towards immigrants and people of color inspired these terrorists to act. 

https://t.co/8O2ccXAX1C
Let us keep them and our brave first responders in our thoughts as we continue to gather the facts about this horrific event. One thing we do know: it's past time for common sense gun reform. We are praying for you, El Paso.
I am absolutely heartbroken by today‚Äôs shooting in my home state of Texas. My heart goes out to the victims and their families that were impacted by this senseless act of violence. https://t.co/y5tuDOCCYR
No one should be experiencing these conditions for any reason, certainly not mothers who are still kids themselves. Cruelty to immigrant teen moms is the exact opposite of American values.

As disturbing as this footage is, I‚Äôm glad the public has a chance to see it. We need this transparency ‚Äì and law enforcement should be clear that allowing the public to verify their accounts is necessary to earn the trust of the communities they serve. https://t.co/4vcBBRmlfa

A wall won‚Äôt make us any safer ‚Äî but the Supreme Court giving the President the power to overrule Congress on the appropriation of funds is a danger to the constitutional separation of powers and our entire system of government. Every American should be concerned.

Emmett Till was a young boy that was tortured and murdered just because of the color of his skin. Yesterday should have been his 78th birthday. This act is completely unacceptable and disrespectful to him and to everyone else that faced racist acts of violence. https://t.co/SXQ0jt7bOp

Annoyed by robocalls? You‚Äôre not alone. Nearly HALF of all calls placed to cell phones this year will be scam calls. That‚Äôs why I voted for the #StopBadRobocalls Act to end the onslaught of robocalls once and for all.
