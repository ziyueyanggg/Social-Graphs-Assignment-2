Trump‚Äôs faux populism is one of the greatest political frauds ever foisted on this nation. https://t.co/PcnxV7kKzU
Trump and his enablers continue to argue that the Constitution is unconstitutional.

This letter could‚Äôve been written by the same authoritarian goons trump admires so much. It‚Äôs garbage, reeking of violent desperation, and won‚Äôt halt Congress one iota. https://t.co/Btddc6CH0O
To all in North Jersey and across the world celebrating #YomKippur, G‚Äômar Chatimah Tovah. I wish you an easy, purposeful fast.
This is the trump treachery republicans are openly defending and trying to coverup.

@lopezobrador_ @RepDanKildee @RepJimmyGomez @RepJimmyPanetta @RepRichardNeal Our discussion went well and we all agreed on the enormous importance of the US-Mexico relationship. President L√≥pez Obrador was forthright and gracious. After this few hours visiting our neighbor to the south, now heading back to Jersey! https://t.co/dx2EQwjLvm
My colleagues and I had the pleasure today of meeting with Mexican President L√≥pez Obrador to discuss a new #NAFTA in a quick, one-day trip.

I made clear to @lopezobrador_ that a new deal must protect US &amp; Mexican workers. Anything less will be a dead letter in Congress. üá∫üá∏ üá≤üáΩ https://t.co/PUUYXnka4V
No wonder trump is obstructing investigations into his extortion of a foreign government. This is gobsmacking, cartoonish corruption. What is trump hiding? https://t.co/wiPdriI265

Republicans leaders: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good that trump obstructed Congress to coverup his treachery. It‚Äôs real good.‚Äù https://t.co/9khwGKJ6t6 https://t.co/Kz5EhK8FHg
Trump now admits to obstructing Congress, says any oversight of him by the Article I branch is illegitimate. We‚Äôre moving forward with our impeachment inquiry. https://t.co/px3M71iLgU
Trump‚Äôs coverup continues. Trump believes he is above all laws and immune to any Article I oversight. This obstructionism won‚Äôt halt our impeachment inquiry into his treachery. https://t.co/F5pQKRV1jz

That‚Äôs because asking foreign countries to attack US elections is a treacherous abuse of power. Current republican leaders know this but just lie about it. https://t.co/sUBkRdBKhc
And despite this enraging unfair tax system, republicans‚Äô solution was to ... bestow a $1.5 trillion tax cut almost entirely to big business tycoons and the 1%. And you paid for it!

https://t.co/siq2T4kJfe
This is a terrifying illustration of the economic inequality tearing America apart. 

Americans rightly demand a fair tax system. My #HR1735 would go a way toward this by finally closing the carried interest loophole long-abused by the 1%. https://t.co/ldMC2qLYV6
The brave #HongKongProtesters are fighting for the lives so of course trump remains cowardly silent to appease the Chinese communist party and makes the protests about himself. What a disgrace. https://t.co/5hxSXE8754
The NBA‚Äôs reaction to support for the #HongKongProtests is shameful and ignorant. I‚Äôve written to the NBA commissioner to ask him if he and his owners value profits over democracy and human dignity. At some point soon they‚Äôll have to pick one of the other. https://t.co/Ysl2LykzIW
And just days after his 95th birthday! A great man and an inspiration. Get well quickly President Carter. https://t.co/iIr07DUThy
The leaders of the republican party know trump‚Äôs treachery is indefensible so they‚Äôve decided to just shamelessly lie about it. They‚Äôre asking you to accept that 2+2=5. https://t.co/6JZoIrXHSq
This is the type of swampy #TrumpCorruption that is devouring our entire exec branch like termites through wood.

Whether trump‚Äòs buddies were also using US foreign policy for personal profiteering must be part of any #ImpeachmentInquiry.

So when trump says he‚Äôs concerned about corruption just remember he‚Äôs presiding over the most corrupt admin in US history. Trump‚Äôs converted the presidency into a cash register he and his family are plundering every day.

Trump sold out the courageous #HongKong demonstrators demanding human dignity against the Chinese communist party's violent crackdown.

Remember when republican leaders claimed to care about freedom and democracy?

Trump also won‚Äôt release his tax returns or put his assets in a blind trust. He doesn‚Äôt give a damn about corruption because he‚Äôs corrupt beyond all measure. https://t.co/IVFnRIVV8X
