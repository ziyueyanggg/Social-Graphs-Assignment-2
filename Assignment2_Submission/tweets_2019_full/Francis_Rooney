To counter sharp power (interference, coercion and meddling) from Russia, China &amp; others, the U.S. must continue to utilize soft power such as diplomacy, Voice of America &amp; aid programs #BipartisanUSIP https://t.co/HDsqPPrV8J

Today, the President signed an Executive Order requiring asylum seekers to process their claims at ports of entries. This is a much needed action after a decade of abuse by people trying to exploit the system that was meant to protect people with legitimate cases. (2/2)

Congressman Francis Rooney statement on federal water quality efforts: https://t.co/FQrlM0Nq6T
Bringing key Congressional appropriators to tour our Everglades and waterways is getting results - $514 million (most ever) to speed dike repairs and reduce harmful discharges, and $115 million for CERP projects that will provide permanent water quality solutions.
In addition to yesterday‚Äôs announcement of $514 million to fix the dike around Lake O., we are on track to receive $115 million for Everglades Restoration Projects. Included is beginning construction on the EAA reservoir, a water storage and filtering area south of the lake.
‚Ä¢Working with @FLGovScott, @MarioDB, and @TomRooney to finally get $514 million appropriated to complete dike repairs years ahead of schedule will result in fewer water releases from Lake O., and better water quality in the Gulf. Thank you!
