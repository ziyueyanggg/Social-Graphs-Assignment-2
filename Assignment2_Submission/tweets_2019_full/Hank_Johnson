Lewandowski was involved in Trump’s repeated obstruction of justice. Trump asked Lewandowski 2x to have Sessions limit Mueller investigation.

4) It is time for the Senate and President Trump to act on these and other measures to prevent the gun violence plaguing our nation. As long as this president continues to hold office, I don’t hold out much hope that the hatred and fear mongering will be solved any time soon.
3) The Democrat-controlled House has passed legislation that would close the gun show loophole and require universal background checks, but Mitch McConnell refuses to allow that legislation to be voted on in the Senate.
2) This cascade of mass killings on our streets is creating a nation of people desensitized to extreme violence. Such violence seems to breed more violence. President Trump &amp; those who blindly support him refuse to acknowledge the truth that his words incite bigotry and violence.
1) So far this year our nation has lived through the trauma and stress of 250 mass casualty shootings. With five months left before the year ends, I fear that we have not seen the last of this extreme violence. https://t.co/USvhebt5PJ
