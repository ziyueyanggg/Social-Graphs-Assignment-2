Rural communities often lack easy access to health care providers, particularly for mental health. Expanding tele-health systems can close the rural-urban gap. It's why I cosponsored the STAR Act, so rural communities don't have to choose between health care and their way of life

Pleasure to work with Judi gaiashkibos of the Nebraska Indian Commission on the new trail bill before Congress demarking the route of Chief Standing Bear and the Ponca people during their forced relocation. I invite you to view our discussion today: https://t.co/XuhGZntWaW
It was an honor to greet and see so many of our Purple Heart veterans and Gold Star families at their Pre-Honor-Flight Dinner last night in La Vista.  All the best on your extraordinary trip today! https://t.co/sOmAUTEDcB
Let‚Äôs be brutally honest: Americans want low prices, China delivers; American farmers depend on new markets for their products, China buys.  There is, however, an uglier side to this dance.  https://t.co/Iw3fnykEcU
This past week the House took concrete steps to help Nebraskans rebuild after the flood. In both the Appropriations Committee on which I serve and before the whole House, key amendments were passed to help our farms, communities, and Offutt Air Force Base https://t.co/vS6wuWIDoN
I am proud to co-sponsor the Richard Lugar Nonproliferation and Arms Control Legacy Resolution, which honors the late Senator's important legacy of leadership on nuclear non-proliferation, which inspired me to co-found the Congressional Nuclear Security Working Group. #nuclear

This week the House of Representatives took concrete steps to help Nebraskans rebuild after the flood. In the Appropriations Committee on which I serve and before the whole House, key amendments were passed to help our farms, communities and @Offutt_AFB https://t.co/pl90I60TIU
The House Appropriations Committee just passed an amendment I cosponsored providing $120M for immediate flood recovery at Offutt. Colleagues on both sides came together to support rebuilding this critical piece of our military infrastructure @Offutt_AFB. https://t.co/mcYBOgn1rE
The House Appropriations Committee just unanimously passed my amendment that provides $300M in disaster funding to Offutt Air Force Base to repair or replace critical infrastructure damaged by recent floods. https://t.co/VnxqYJTSxn @Offutt_AFB
One million men and women maintain the home front while our service members defend America. The Military Spouse of the Year Award recognizes spouses‚Äô contributions to our military community and country. Congrats to this year‚Äôs Whiteman AFB winner Amber Conroy of Lincoln. https://t.co/BunPtLzMr5
Joining with other members of Congress, I'm urging the EPA to halt biofuel waivers for large or unqualified refiners under the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) program.Waiver expansion hurts our farmers, impedes our ability to meet RFS goals and increases dependence on foreign oil.
The vast majority of Americans, even if they may be pro-choice, do not want taxpayer dollars commingled in the provision of abortion. I invite you to review my statement on behalf of the Hyde Amendment today during appropriations markups: https://t.co/yKE69g0fxW #ProLife
At a Labor HHS full markup meeting today, I spoke in support of cooperative health plans, an innovative, lower-cost health insurance solution for rural communities priced out of existing health care markets. https://t.co/SDjIQ7h320 #ag
The Security Resolution for Northern Iraq helps provide closure to America‚Äôs involvement in Iraq, ensures justice for the oppressed, stability for Iraq, and preservation of Iraq‚Äôs rich tapestry of religious pluralism so essential for peace in the Mideast https://t.co/pvSqoExqn8
An interesting dynamic in Washington is the fellows program. An amazing young man from Thailand‚Äôs foreign ministry is serving us for one year. This week, Surat Suwannikkha went home for the coronation of King Maha Vajiralongkorn. #Thailand https://t.co/w7QcuYQC08
This past weekend Senator Richard Lugar died. I knew him. He was incredible leader, especially in the space of nuclear weapons use. He left an important legacy here in the U.S. Congress.
Safety in cosmetics is a key issue receiving increased attention in Congress. Recently the head of the FDA testified before my committee that Congress needs to give the FDA authority to require warning labels on #cosmetics &amp; personal care products https://t.co/X7XKGzBFX7 @US_FDA
Today at the Nebraska Breakfast I met Boyd Sponaugle of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency and UNO Professor Sachin Pawaskar, whose pioneering team, using advanced data analytics, helped identify the remains of six Nebraskans from the USS Oklahoma lost at Pearl Harbor.
The Air Force has informed the Nebraska Congressional Delegation that the Offutt runway reconstruction is proceeding apace. There should not be any delays due to flooding.
In Congress, there are often quiet, discerning moments of respectful dialogue. The collegial tone belies the hysterical binary animus the media gin up on an hourly basis. This false antagonism is never more pronounced than in discussions of the environment.https://t.co/6Fe0LDhwnm
So honored to appear with former intern Nibras Khudaida on NET's Speaking of Nebraska. We discussed the work we are doing in Congress to enable the safe return of her #Yazidi people to their ancestral homelands in Iraq. The segment airs tonight at 8:30 PM https://t.co/koaaiY6vS3 https://t.co/WiRR1G4OFG
Congrats to Lincoln intern Pranav Rajan on his acceptance to the prestigious NASA SEES Internship Program. Pranav competed against 600 other students to make the cut for this 9%-acceptance-rate program. He will develop flood preparedness solutions by analyzing our recent floods. https://t.co/z25kTJl2Nx
A core principle of civilization is the protection of human dignity. Today, we remember the 104th anniversary of the systemic arrest, deportation, and mass murder of Armenians during WWI. I will continue to work to ensure we never see the worst of humanity again #ArmenianGenocide
I invite you to view this video about our former intern Nibras Khudaida's inspiring story of escape from ISIS genocide to high school valedictorian to Creighton undergrad. So proud of Nibras and our Lincoln Yazidi community, the nation‚Äôs largest https://t.co/AK9fumgC2L #Yazidis
The Mueller Report should be thoroughly evaluated, but not used to create a permanent political crisis. https://t.co/lyeyJd3nIN #MullerReport
To You and Your Family:

Happy Passover and Blessed Easter!
"No one should be alone.‚Äù Pastor John Kunze and the ministry team at Messiah Lutheran Church offered a faithful and beautiful funeral service today in remembrance of Coby Mach. The painful reality of his death was reconciled with the message of hope, healing, and salvation.
A new national survey has found that one-third of Americans do not believe that six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust.  Two-thirds of Americans have never heard of Auschwitz.  Half could not name a single concentration camp or ghetto. https://t.co/bhXcitCVTY
Met with Nebraska State Bar Association, which informed me that Legal Aid of Nebraska is providing pro bono legal triage to those encountering legal hurdles related to the flood.  Call 1-844-268-5627 to get help. @LegalAidNEB @nebrbar
As a college student, I studied French in Paris.  To see Notre Dame in flames is personally jarring‚Äì‚Äìbut the loss is for the world, a site of immeasurable heritage.  It reminds us that all things are passing.
I am grieved by the death of my friend Coby Mach. He was a strong leader, and a passionate advocate for our community‚Äîwith a big heart. I will miss him. May God give him rest.
As flood recovery efforts continue, I had a good discussion with Taryn and Jon Vanderford on Pure Nebraska on the proposed flood relief out of Washington and the great sacrifice many Nebraskans have made to help those in need. https://t.co/sHCaLWbDW5 @purenebraska
James Wilke was a farmer from near Columbus, #Nebraska who gave his life during the rushing flood waters to help a person stranded. Yesterday, I sent a letter to President Trump asking that he kindly consider Mr. Wilke for the Presidential Citizens Medal. https://t.co/Ie7CGSUXt4
The deadline to enter the Congressional Art Competition is fast approaching! Be sure to get your submissions in by this Monday, April 15. https://t.co/Vh4G9X5qbG
I invite you to view my House speech showcasing the selfless ways Nebraskans are helping neighbors in need. I urge Congress to also transcend differences to back bipartisan disaster relief legislation. https://t.co/lEHJB9VVG4
An unanticipated damage from the flood was the destruction and loss of grain stored on farms. Secretary of Agriculture Perdue and I conversed today about how we can potentially solve this problem. @SecretarySonny @USDA https://t.co/dJDQ8SQt2C
Congratulations to General Hyten on his nomination to serve as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General Hyten is an incredible leader and a tireless defender of our country. Most important, he is clear.  @US_Stratcom
I saw FEMA representatives in Saunders County today. If you have had any flood damage, good idea to let them talk to you to see if you qualify. They are working hard to ensure that Nebraskans receive any aid to which they are entitled. @fema #Nebraska
Maturity demands time, guidance, and the wisdom of the ages. In spite of this argument, 100 plus Members of Congress voted to give 16-year-olds the right to vote. I did not. Let me know how you would vote on the issue. https://t.co/F0fpGPScnP
I'm supporting an effort to expand the use of biodiesel, a sustainable source of clean reliable fuel that supports thousands of green jobs in Nebraska and across the U.S. #cleanenergy #biodiesel
I invite you to view my exchange with outgoing Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb about the science, ethics, dangers, and benefits of animal biotechnology. https://t.co/GoJ8Rll0c4 @SGottliebFDA https://t.co/EgYMRgM4Zu
Pleasure to see University of Nebraska President Hank Bounds and the Board of Regents today. I‚Äôve appreciated Hank‚Äôs leadership. Good discussion on how we work to make Nebraska an inviting place to learn, work, and raise a family @hankbounds
I just signed the discharge petition for the Born Alive Infant Protection Act. Meaning: It is my way of demanding that the House of Representatives vote to save the life of a baby who miraculously survives an abortion attempt.
Good to see young people so engaged in the civic process yesterday at Humanities Nebraska's Capitol Forum Day. Thank you for your thoughtful questions on agriculture, trade, the flood response, and, from our Hastings friends‚Äîfavorite flavor of Kool-Aid!  (strawberry). https://t.co/RqtZG0MpS0
In the Paradise Lakes neighborhood of Bellevue, the flood completely covered some houses. A vet named Josh, holding a remnant from his home, told me, ‚ÄúI still got my family. I still got my flag. That‚Äôs what counts.‚Äù https://t.co/JMjrBo5wLc
The amazing response of initial community shelters is being formalized into federal disaster recovery centers, where those affected by the storm can meet with FEMA, @USDA and Small Business Administration (SBA) personnel. https://t.co/CClUqXP4UG @fema @SBAgov
As I told @SecPompeo the situation in No. Iraq can be summarized in three words: possibility, urgency, security. Rep. Eshoo and I just introduced a Resolution calling for Christians, #Yazidis and minority Islamic communities to be trained and integrated into Iraq security forces. https://t.co/FJrD36FGZ5
Nebraska continues to be in the running for a possible relocation of USDA's Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture.  Lots of support, lots of opposition to the proposal. @USDA #AgTwitter
I conducted a long interview with the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists on a new policy initiative for nuclear nonproliferation. https://t.co/luO1HZUo7R @BulletinAtomic #nuclearsecurity
Great to see Columbus High yesterday. Anchor down! @DiscovererWay https://t.co/SgBVEI0g3z
Wisner-Pilger Public Schools‚Äîgreat representation today at the Nebraska Breakfast! @WisnerPilger https://t.co/4i8ZefgSuc
Important exchange with Secretary of State Pompeo on stabilization of Northern Iraq, protection of religious minorities, and regenerating our strategic friendship with Egypt. https://t.co/6GHN2ckCie @SecPompeo
I got a weird but officially-sounding call from the Social Security Administration on my personal phone. I checked it out. Beware. It‚Äôs a scam. Do not press 1 or give out your Social Security number.
Here‚Äôs some footage of the flood damage in our communities and the remarkable response of local leadership, and of neighbor helping neighbor. https://t.co/e2mUq6HEWR
