This is a partisan witch hunt that operates in secrecy to leak manipulated facts and outright lies about @realDonaldTrump without due process or transparency. https://t.co/mvNo6PzIoz
In refusing to censure Adam Schiff for his egregious abuse of the public trust, Democrats have shown their goal is to nullify the 2016 election and carry out a soft coup against @realDonaldTrump.
Adam Schiff lied about having substantial evidence of @realDonaldTrump /Russia collusion, read a fraudulent record of the Ukraine phone call, and lied again about not coordinating with the so-called whistle blower. This man must be censured for his lies.

Thankfully, the House failed to overturn the President's veto of a bill to block that emergency, and he can proceed with securing our southern border. #LA05 https://t.co/eD5QRCvCgB
I cannot wait to sign this petition. Republicans have tried 20 times to vote on the Born Alive bill and #EndInfanticide, and 20 times Democrats have blocked it. We deserve a chance to vote on this bill so that we can protect babies who survive abortions. #LetUsVote https://t.co/m6SkKjFKyE

Today we celebrate #NationalMedalofHonorDay and recognize our military heroes who‚Äôve gone above and beyond their call of duty. I‚Äôm grateful for their sacrifices and salute them today and every day. https://t.co/HlazpL14Ye
#Israel is under attack from cowardly terrorists who shoot rockets at women and children. The Israeli people have every right to defend themselves, and I stand with them as they seek out those responsible for these attacks.
House Republicans have tried 19 times to pass the Born-Alive Act and 19 times, House Democrats have refused. That‚Äôs 19 times that Democrats have failed to stand up for life and block infanticide. https://t.co/QsRKAkPXE3
Next week we celebrate National Medal of Honor Day. If you need help receiving medals from your time in the service, please contact my district offices. Service to our nation is never forgotten &amp; I'm dedicated to seeing that our veterans get the honor &amp; treatment they deserve. https://t.co/0firZjm6jF
This week, border patrol agents apprehended 400 illegal immigrants in 5-minute period trying to cross our border. This is a small glimpse at how overwhelmed our border has become and just how desperately a border wall is needed. https://t.co/EPovAHKCFm
‚ÄúRemember when Democrats complained that $5.7 billion for a border wall was too expensive?‚Äù Democrats' agenda adds up to $100 trillion. It's upsetting that they're focused on ending air travel &amp; securing their Green New Deal instead of securing our border. https://t.co/go6O6DvbWJ
Agriculture drives the economies of so many areas in Louisiana and across the country. The strong future of the agriculture and farming industry is something to celebrate and I‚Äôm glad to see @SecretarySonny ringing it in on the @NYSE. https://t.co/R1B7zspqmi
I'm so proud of these students from @ULM_Official for honoring our nation's veterans in such a powerful way. Thank you for Talons for Taps for all you do for America's heroes. https://t.co/ldEcoAUb0o
It‚Äôs been over a month since @SteveScalise first called for House Dems to bring the Born Alive Act to the floor. They‚Äôve ignored every attempt at bringing this lifesaving legislation to a vote. I'll continue to stand up for the unborn &amp; ask House Dems to bring this to the floor.
Happy 100th Birthday to the @AmericanLegion! Thank you for the endless support and community you provide to our veterans everywhere. https://t.co/yCXzqWvDCx
Last week, House Dems passed their latest legislative power grad. Under the H.R. 1 the average candidate would receive $2.15 million. My vote against this bill was to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being spent responsibly, not subsidizing politicians &amp; suppressing free speech. https://t.co/5smXLamEYk
Congratulations to Grady Coburn, from Rapides Parish, on being inducted into the LA Agriculture Hall of Distinction! Crop consultants and researchers like Grady give unique insights to aid farmers and ensure Louisiana crops thrive. https://t.co/pBExLK332l
I have three of my six granddaughters in town today! This morning, I told them they can achieve anything they want, and never let anyone say they can't because they're girls. They can have my job one day or the one down the street at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. #LA05 https://t.co/BmcpadNVFM
As one of the largest row crop districts in the nation, agriculture plays a vital role in #LA05. Today as we celebrate #NationalAgDay, I want to say ‚ÄúThank You!‚Äù to the over 26,000 farmers in Louisiana who work sun up to sun down and are the lifeblood of our state. https://t.co/5wda0uwisD

I voted against #HR1, the Democratic Politician Protection Act. My full statement is below. In short, this bill was #ForthePoliticians, not #ForThePeople. https://t.co/hExaNE1cqg
Bigotry &amp; hatred have no place in our discourse, just as anti-Semite @Ilhan has no place serving on @HouseForeign. I voted to condemn the anti-Semitism she has repeatedly espoused, but this bill should have specifically denounced her statements &amp; removed her from the committee.
Congratulations to my friend Dr. John Fleming on his confirmation today. I served with John in Congress and know he will do an outstanding job in this new role in President Trump's admin to help further the economic growth that we've seen under our President's leadership. https://t.co/V2cOaeYUrO
Gianna, Melissa, Claire, Nik &amp; Josiah survived abortions, &amp; their stories are examples of the potential each life has ‚Äì potential &amp; dignity that's stripped away by abortion. When babies survive abortion, they should be treated with the same care that any other baby would receive. https://t.co/IsFRWNt8Ns
This week, Dems are pushing H.R. 1 - the Democrat Politician Protection Act.  This bill is full of fraud, abuse &amp; misuse of Louisianans taxes, and puts the integrity of our elections at risk. It takes away responsibilities from the states and puts it in the hands of bureaucrats. https://t.co/FqLW6uC8oD

Doctors like me vow to do no harm. @AmerMedicalAssn is failing to live up to that standard by joining @PPFA to sue @realDonaldTrump over new #TitleX rule. AMA doesn't speak for all doctors because most of us want to save lives, not kill babies. #ProLife https://t.co/Llaxdpii9Y

Green New Disaster is right. Democrats proposed ideas in the #GreenNewDeal would be an absolute disaster for Louisiana, especially to our communities built around the energy industry that is so important to our economy. https://t.co/U5bJVPT6XP
More than 250,000 veterans call Louisiana home. I voted to pass the #VAMissionAct so that our nation‚Äôs heroes can get the care they deserved. By streamlining programs and cutting red tape, the VA Mission Act put our veterans first and bureaucracy last. https://t.co/4mKZFAnTQ8
ICYMI Senate Dems voted against giving abortion surviving babies medical care. My stance is clear: failing to provide care to a child born alive is infanticide. I cosponsored the House bill &amp; joined @SteveScalise &amp; @RepAnnWagner's effort for a a floor vote https://t.co/RrK3bSJRZ5

Millie's story shows that no one is immune to the opioid epidemic. Families like the Harveys are why the House passed H.R. 6 last session, the SUPPORT Act, which provided millions of dollars in funding to Louisiana to address this crisis. https://t.co/IPnq4VttkY

If President Trump needs to declare a #NationalEmergency to keep out the drugs and gangs, so be it because it's pretty clear that Democrats' only goal is to score political points with their radical open-borders base, even if it means sacrificing national security. #LA05
I voted NO. This bill limits the number of illegal immigrants we can detain &amp; falls well short of adequate funding for a border wall. I couldn't vote for something that's going to dictate to the President whether or not he can protect our borders and keep our country safe. #LA05
As a pilot, I‚Äôve seen firsthand ‚Äì from the cockpit ‚Äì how aviation connects us to each other.

The #GreenNewDeal is a socialist‚Äôs wish list. It focuses less on the environment and more on progressive, leftist ideals under the disguise of creating a greener America. This bill is a true look at the shallow priorities Democrats have in Congress.
