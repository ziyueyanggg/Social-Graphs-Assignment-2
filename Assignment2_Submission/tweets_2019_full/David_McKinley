Murray Energy‚Äôs announcement not only highlights the dire state of coal but the fast-approaching insolvency of the UMWA 1974 Pension Fund.
In the face of yet another coal bankruptcy, we must look for ways to help ensure a market for coal exists by promoting fuel security and grid resilience.
We hope that as Murray Energy works to find a solution that will allow them to continue to operate, they remember that thousands of people depend on them for their livelihoods

Gray, who played at WVU from 1988-1991, was 1 of the nearly 3,000 people who died in the September 11th attacks. https://t.co/WrFLWAeM7d
Today, we pause to remember, the lives of those lost and to honor the first responders who put their lives on the line to save others.

https://t.co/XgTjqIQTzK
We must not only remember what we saw, but we must ensure the memory of those lost and the bravery of our first responders and troops in the aftermath of the attack lives on.
Eighteen years ago, nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives in the most devastating act of terrorism this nation has ever seen. We must never forget the horrific scenes we witnessed or the pride and patriotism that brought us together in that time of national mourning.
Eighteen years ago more than three thousand of our friends and neighbors ate their breakfast, kissed their loved ones....and walked into history.  First responders ran towards the aftermath of terrorism.  We must never forget them.  God bless this country.
