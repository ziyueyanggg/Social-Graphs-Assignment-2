Meanwhile, both the @HUDOIG and @USGAO have raised important questions about HUD‚Äôs internal capacity, staffing, and oversight of the CDBG-DR program.
Of course, the CDBG-DR program is bigger than just PR, although PR does seem to have been singled out.  Many states, including NC, are implementing action plans or awaiting additional notices from HUD to use disaster funding that was appropriated last yr &amp; in June of this yr.
The other affected states had to wait 18 months, which was bad enough, but Puerto Rico is STILL waiting...

ICYMI: In PR‚ÄîNearly 3,000 people lost their lives, and tens of thousands of homes were damaged. I've been to PR and seen these challenges first hand.
But that's not even the full story, rather than comply with the clear statutory deadline (included in bipartisan legislation signed by the President) to issue the Fed Reg notice, @HUDgov is still withholding the notice for PUERTO RICO.
Low and middle-income families can‚Äôt wait 547 days to rebuild after a devastating storm.
Issuing the Federal Register notice has taken longer in recent years.

After Sandy in 2012, it took 35 days.  After the 2017 hurricanes, it took 145 days.  And more recently it took 547 days, and even then the notice came only after Congress included a deadline by law.
Without this notice, states (like NC) cannot submit action plans to @Hudgov, sign a grant agreement, and begin to use the $‚Äînecessary steps that take at least several months once the notice is issued.
Unfortunately, Congress has never formally approved the CDBG-DR program. 

This means each time Congress gives $, @HUDgov must issue a notice in the Federal Register that outlines how the funds can be used.
In 2017 alone, Congress set aside more than $35 billion across the federal government for people recovering from major hurricanes: Harvey, Irma, &amp; Maria.

To put this into perspective, HUD‚Äôs entire budget in the last fiscal year was approximately $54 billion.
Since 1993, Congress has provided more than $86 billion in funding for the CDBG-DR program.  As the severity and frequency of storms have increased, so has the need for funding. *climate change*
The grants primarily benefit low- and moderate-income people in the most impacted and distressed areas.
.@HUDgov‚Äôs Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery program (CDBG-DR) is a flexible &amp; vital tool for states &amp; municipalities to recover from major disasters. Grantees use this funding to reconstruct damaged housing &amp; repair public facilities such as community centers.
THREAD: Today's @AppropsDems hearing highlights the Trump admin‚Äôs @HUDgov failure to follow the law &amp; issue CDBG-DR mitigation notices for all grantees by the required deadline.

Rep. Cummings fought for our democracy until the end - challenging us all to live up to the highest ideals set out in our Constitution. His most familiar comment in the midst of our current difficulties was ‚ÄúWe are better than this.‚Äù He left our country better than he found it.
Every day, he fought passionately for the civil rights and the dignity of all people, often reminding colleagues and constituents alike that ‚Äúdiversity is our promise, not our problem.‚Äù
@RepCummings legacy showcases the promise of America. The son of a sharecropper, he rose to become one of the most respected voices in the halls of Congress. Fortunately, he made many visits to North Carolina, on which his powerful oratory &amp; personal warmth were on full display.
