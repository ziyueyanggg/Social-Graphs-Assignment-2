Members walked out on Chairman Takano when he undemocratically refused to debate amendments that would help all veterans, including women, and or recognize Republicans attempting to speak.

Democrats won't even allow a debate on my amendment protecting children.

This hyper-partisan, closed-door process is not only unprecedented, it lacks any semblance of fundamental fairness under the Constitution.
How can anyone say they support impeachment when only a handful of Members of Congress can hear witness testimony, when exculpatory evidence is excluded from selective leaks to the press, and when the President's lawyers have no right to call or cross examine witnesses?
https://t.co/WsBLHBvcat
It’s obvious they don’t want the American people to have access to the full record of facts.
If Chairman Schiff and Speaker Pelosi want Members of Congress to vote on impeachment, why do they refuse to hold open and transparent hearings that would give this President the same due process afforded to President Clinton?
I further call for his resignation as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee.

So this hearing was analogous to the arsonist blaming the firefighter for the inferno engulfing the house.
The Members of Congress who convened this hearing to blame anyone but themselves for the student loan debt crisis are the very same politicians who orchestrated the government takeover of student loans, which has resulted in an explosion of student loan debt.

We need to focus on maximum wages not minimum wages.  I want workers to earn a lot more than $15 per hour.  But to give that opportunity to as many workers as possible we need economic growth—not central planning from Washington.
And less than 20 percent of workers who would see a wage increase under this bill actually live in households that earn less than the federal poverty line. 

We need to focus on policies that will increase wages for all workers, not just minimum wage workers.
Also -

There are mountains of evidence that a higher federally mandated minimum wage leads to fewer workers hired.  Regardless, whether you are for or against raising the minimum wage, we have to stop thinking so small.  Less than 3% of American workers earn the minimum wage.

Republicans support higher wages, and I applaud those who are trying to create better pay for American workers. But raising the minimum wage is the wrong path. It is bad for Kentucky and bad our country.
A minimum wage hike would have a negative impact on entry-level and part-time jobs, especially for those under the age of 25 just starting careers. It would result in $9 billion net reduction in family income. This would NOT help low-income families - it would hurt them.
MYTH: Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour will increase family income. FACT: Raising the minimum wage will reduce pay for many American families.
Under the Trump Administration, the economy has experienced sustainable and significant job creation. A $15 minimum wage hike would reverse these wins, resulting in roughly $3.7 million jobs LOST.
Today I voted against the Raise the Wage Act, a misguided attempt to increase income for workers, which would reduce jobs in the Kentucky. https://t.co/hWQzsGZrsx

Today, the House passed my Otto Warmbier North Korea Sanctions Act as an amendment to the NDAA. The bottom line is simple – foreign banks can either do business benefitting North Korea, or business with the United States. They cannot do both. More:

As a parent of two little girls, I would not put my children in the care of a child-care provider that was employing someone who had been charged with a sex offense, even if they had not yet gone to trial. Period. End of story.

https://t.co/VM97CAeIzI
Child care for veterans is part of the civilian transition process that we need to address. Not adopting a noncontroversial amendment to protect children from child-care workers who have been charged with abusing children makes no sense to me.

https://t.co/fQEhX9TEXY
Child-care services is a major benefit for veterans seeking care at the VA. We should ensure this service is safe, but Democrats decided to stop my amendment protecting veteran children.

I appreciate the much improved communication Fed Chairman Jay Powell provides to Congress on the direction of monetary policy. You can hear my entire exchange today with Chair Powell here:

https://t.co/2nWGTiEzap
Don’t forget to tune in tonight for my Congressional Update on @KET. https://t.co/mykkfQsUNN
While acknowledging the need for better skills based education and workforce development policies, Chairman Powell pushed back on Democrats’ obsession with “income inequality” testifying that in the Trump economy, “wage gains have have been greater for lower-skilled workers.”
Fed Chairman Powell says that while the Fed doesn’t take a position on whether Congress should raise the federal minimum wage, studies show that an increase in the minimum wage will result workers losing their jobs.
Chairman Powell says “Our baseline outlook is for economic growth to remain solid, labor markets to stay strong, and inflation to move back up over time to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.”
Listening to Fed Chairman Powell’s testimony in Committee. His patience on rate cuts underscores the Fed’s overall confidence in the strength of the Trump economy, despite low inflation and slowing global growth.

... that blocks the deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons on submarines—a move that the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review deems crucial to deterring Russia.
Every day that goes by, Democrats prove their impeachment obsession is more about politics than national security.  If Democrats really cared about countering Russian aggression, then they wouldn’t have passed a highly partisan NDAA bill out of the Armed Services Committee...
More evidence that President Trump has been tougher on Russia than President Obama. So much for the Democrats’ conspiracy theories.
