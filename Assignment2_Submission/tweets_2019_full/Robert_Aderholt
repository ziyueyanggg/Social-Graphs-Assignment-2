The death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is the culmination of this effort and will help to save American lives.
When @realDonaldTrump took office in 2017, ISIS was still a very serious threat &amp; our efforts to eradicate the group were not getting the job done.  But he gave our military the authority and tools to get the job done.

The strength of the American economy, and the American consumer, comes with a lot of negotiating power.  Power that has too often not been used, to the detriment of American workers.  Those days are over.
All throughout the 2016 campaign, Democrats laughed at the idea we could renegotiate our trade deals.  With this important step towards a new NAFTA deal, President @realDonaldTrump has once again proven these critics wrong.
I would also be remiss not to mention his unwavering support for making sure we have the strongest military in the world. His life was dedicated to public service.
I’m sorry to hear of the death of Senator John McCain.  He and so many other American military personnel survived an existence as a POW in Vietnam that most of us could never imagine.  My prayers to his family during this difficult time.

Best of luck to all of Alabama’s Fourth Congressional District’s high school football teams as they kickoff the new football season tonight! I especially want to wish the @AHS_Rams luck as they host their first home game in their new stadium tonight. #RamNation https://t.co/Wr00Xvugtm
Today I was honored to receive the Champion Award by the Boys and Girls Club of Alabama. https://t.co/v8ocRt1v2s
Since it’s completion, Interstate 22 has proved that Alabama’s Fourth Congressional District is open for business. 
https://t.co/L4fDHRILYN
This morning Carbon Hill received some great news! Carbon Hill will be home to the next Rolling T Truck Stop on Interstate 22. The project will lead to a dozen new jobs and the expansion of future commerce in the area. https://t.co/I0gfja3eYR
It was great being in studio today with @DonDaileyAPT for an interview for @CapitolJournal. A small portion will air tomorrow night and will run in its entirety August 31 at 8pm on @APTV https://t.co/NNKY5AAOCs
I remain focused on the positives this administration has delivered on economic growth, rolling back overreaching government regulations and acting like the super-power we are.
Many on the left want to jump on these Cohen and Manafort cases as if it is also an automatic conviction of the President. The reality is that we don’t know what impact, if any, this will have on the President. They are just grasping at anything.
I applaud these changes. They will protect the environment while also protecting Alabama jobs. The Obama era rules were overreaching and job killing. https://t.co/27QHbxgQw4
It’s always fun to get to drop by WRAB in Arab and visit with Archie Anderson, especially during “America’s Favorite Program,” the Helping Hand. I hope I can do it again soon. https://t.co/gqLTymm2vI
Alabama and the 4th District are open for business. More Alabamians are working and making more than they have in 11 years. No doubt we are #BetterOffNow due to our Republican pro-growth agenda. Thanks, but you can keep your socialism.
Two of the top five counties in Alabama with record low unemployment are right here in the 4th District. Cullman County, where we just recently attended another business expansion at Royal Technologies, and Marshall County.  Cullman is at 3.5% and Marshall 3.7% https://t.co/ri2ai6OJMW
Good morning Oakman!  Just one of the many great communities in the 4th District. https://t.co/3EP8Vv4Za7
The music world has lost a legend in Aretha Franklin.  One of her most famous song, RESPECT, was recorded right here in the 4th District on February 14, 1967. And what a Valentine gift it was. Her voice was one of the many that gave richly to the Muscle Shoals Music. https://t.co/dgx8rv4lpm
There is not a country on earth that has done more good for more people than America. This country most definitely has been great, and thanks to President Trump, we are going to be great again.  https://t.co/f1CwKNzeUV
The Fourth Congressional District is the largest poultry producing district in Alabama. I’m thrilled to know that Koch Foods is further investing in our community and our hard working people of the District. https://t.co/aKzLJ9DhvH
If the outcome had been different in November of 2016, the outcome for these Alabama miners would be completely different today.  #MAGA #makecoalgreatagain @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/Sd8L9QByAC
This Summer I had the privilege to work alongside these young leaders who recently completed their internships in my D.C. office. I greatly appreciate their work and the dedication these outstanding, young Alabamians did on behalf of the 4th Congressional District. https://t.co/2iiNnQgUro
The Black Sea Area Support Team is serving in Romania - a long way from home and loved ones. While we couldn’t send black-eyed peas, collard greens or sweet tea, we did send an Alabama state flag to let them how much they are appreciated. May God bless them and the USA! https://t.co/bcJJEFet0r
It was my pleasure to help honor Judge Horton. https://t.co/v1cvBRc5Ar
Need proof that the tax cuts Congress passed is working? Ask the 1.5 million people that have new jobs since it passed.  Economy is on pace to hit 3% annual growth as businesses expand and create jobs...what a difference a new president can make @realdonaldtrump #MAGA https://t.co/N06yjwSLXq
Pastor Brunson’s imprisonment is a clear example of how Turkey continues to move in the wrong direction. I applaud @realDonaldTrump to stand-up against Christian persecution. https://t.co/jahMmgRS5E
The American economy continues to thrive because of @POTUS’ pro-growth policies. Alabama is #BetterOffNow because of President Trump. #MAGA https://t.co/qv2jF70IOm
Today I spoke about the importance of religious belief at ⁦⁦@Heritage⁩. The American pastor wrongfully detained in Turkey &amp; recent efforts to ban faith-based groups from adoption services shows now more than ever we must protect such an important right for our democracy. https://t.co/YpU34cNEhu
Today the @HouseAppropsGOP passed its 12th and final appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2019, the Homeland Security funding bill. The bill includes $5 billion for new border wall construction and security. I am proud to help @POTUS keep his promise to build the Wall. https://t.co/9jXeydl8dY
Alabama’s 4th District knows football better than any other district. Thanks to a local artist, Aaron Sullivan, students at Cullman’s Parkside Elementary School will be “kicking off” their school year ready to learn.

Countdown to @AlabamaFTBL: 38 days https://t.co/kgw0PNT4pC
I have always supported Alabama farmers. That’s why I support @POTUS’ decision today to stand by our nation’s farmers who are suffering from unjust and illegal trade retaliation. Read my full statement here:

Happy to meet @al_ffa officers this morning. It’s always good to hear from our young leaders in agriculture. #NextGenAg https://t.co/WRsgWfbuA7
Today, I attended the @WhiteHouse’s ‘Made in America’ exhibit featuring @redlandcotton from Moulton, AL. Alabama small businesses and American manufactures are making a strong comeback and Alabama is helping lead the charge. #MadeInAmerica https://t.co/rbB6qwtPAe
Red Land Cotton Sheets, based in Alabama and right here in the 4th District , will represent all of us today at a Made in America event at the White House.  Proud to have this great company in Lawrence County. https://t.co/4dVWR8aXWe
Stay weather aware this evening and overnight.  There could be severe weather across North Alabama, including some tornadoes. https://t.co/LySfIdG3Qr
This morning I met with the Guatemalan Ambassador, Manuel Espina, to discuss joint international efforts to combat human trafficking, drug smuggling, and illegal immigration. Security begins at home. https://t.co/uSlj2dLxwO
I commend the work of @POTUS and @SecPompeo as they work to bring home the remains of thousands of Americans held since the Korean War. I applaud the continuation of diplomacy following @realDonaldTrump’s Singapore Summit. https://t.co/T3EHVwaTHW
Spoke to @JasonCalvi of @EWTN’s @EWTNNewsNightly about the amendment I offered protecting religious organizations, such as ⁦@CCharitiesUSA⁩ and @Bethany, from being excluded from providing adoption and foster care services because of their sincerely held religious beliefs. https://t.co/imuABPILdY
As a Christian and a father, I am proud to have passed this amendment. Read my full statement here: 
https://t.co/IXECp6Pant
Today my colleagues and I of the @HouseAppropsGOP passed my amendment which prohibits the discrimination of child welfare providers based on religious beliefs or moral convictions.
@RepChuck is a stalwart in Congress for protecting religious freedoms. I’m always glad to have him on my fighting side on any issue - particularly his help in passing this one! https://t.co/eS2rE09Jnw
This morning I was happy to join the Osborne family, from Albertville, AL, on a tour of the @uscapitol. I look forward to welcoming many more families of Alabama’s Fourth Congressional District to our nation’s capital. https://t.co/GjTQjCKPdx
It warms my heart to know they have promised to continue to serve and are planning to return to their missionary work in Haiti. https://t.co/bEOnK5S0NU
It brings me great joy to know the missionaries of Russellville First Baptist Church have landed back in the U.S. safe &amp; sound. While serving those less fortunate &amp; spreading the good word of the gospel, the group was caught in worrisome protests.
Great to meet Peyton West, of Brookwood, Alabama, who is in town attending the Youth Legislative Training Conference hosted by the @AACS_DC. Thankful for your service to Congress during your week-long conference. https://t.co/EKNQGlkwF4
My colleagues in the Senate should get to work immediately to forego all of the August Recess in order to confirm his nomination. #SCOTUS Read my statement below: 
https://t.co/IhiK0ciJah
@POTUS has delivered on his promise to nominate a candidate who is immensely qualified and will serve as an honorable guardian and interpreter of the United States Constitution.
The best things to come out of Louisiana are gumbo and the current House Majority Whip. Alabama is, of course, home to the birthplace of Mardi Gras and the 2018 College Football Champions. Roll Tide! https://t.co/jmZsOp2Av0
From Northport to Muscle Shoals and Cullman to Henagar, Alabamians of the 4th Congressional District will be able to celebrate Independence Day with millions of Americans. Check out @waff48 to see how best to commemorate the birth of our nation.
https://t.co/Ii90mDpzui
Always grateful to help out a fellow Alabamian, and Representative, @RepTerriSewell. Thanks for the 4th of July cupcakes in return! https://t.co/ogL0my6jlG
About 6 months ago, @POTUS signed the #TaxCutsandJobsAct putting money back into the pockets of taxpayers. Today, @USDA stated the new tax code will ease the burden on farmers across the nation allowing them to further boost the economy and put more food on American tables. https://t.co/FaQlQPcwEZ
Thanks to the @60PlusAssoc for presenting me the Guardian of Seniors’ Rights award. I am proud to advocate for saving Social Security and Medicare for today’s seniors while strengthening it for future generations. https://t.co/5JjmntolBS
While Justice Kennedy proudly served the American people, I look forward to @POTUS nominating an honorable and well-qualified jurist. I encourage the U.S. Senate to not wait but to act quickly to confirm the President’s eventual nominee before the new Supreme Court term begins.
This morning I spoke to the Joint Select Committee on Budget &amp; Appropriations Process Reform on how Congress can get back to regular order and away from continuing resolutions and omnibus appropriations bills- it starts with the U.S. Senate getting away from their filibuster rule https://t.co/ffQjJCMdy1
“Had a great working lunch with President Trump today to discuss the way forward on Appropriations so that we can fund the border wall as well as avoid another huge Omnibus” @realdonaldtrump #Appropriations https://t.co/Bf6BVANLGG
Two great rulings today from SCOTUS. The court struck down the California law that forced pro-life groups to advertise abortion. And the court upheld the power Congress gave the President to limit travel to America to protect national security.
