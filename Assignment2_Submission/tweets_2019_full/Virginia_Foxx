This week, in a fleeting moment of bipartisanship, the House voted to consider my legislation to take spending off autopilot. Amid the partisan caps bill put forth and then pulled by @HouseDemocrats, I was pleased my Spending Safeguard Amendment was accepted for debate. (2/4)
Unchecked spending is the main driver of our national debt, and by 2028, it will constitute a whopping 15% of our GDP. This is simply unsustainable. Yet there are no commonsense safeguards to rein in spending beyond our budget. (1/4)

that considers only 1 of 2 people involved in an abortion. I‚Äôll continue to fight for the rights of the unborn, and I pray for our culture to realize their rights are not a threat to women‚Äôs rights. All life is valuable and deserves to be protected by law, not legally devalued.
And these policies lay bare the extreme agenda of the pro-abortion movement. Nothing warrants such evil and rendering the life of the unborn indefensible or permitting infanticide are no ways to ensure women‚Äôs health. These extremisms follow from a radical and callous belief...
These policies systematically remove the rights of the unborn from existing law, and the NY law goes so far as to revoke healthcare for babies born after a botched abortion. They fly in the face of the limits on abortion that most Americans support.
The Reproductive Health Act law being celebrated by pro-abortion activists in NY and VA‚Äôs Repeal Act bill supported by abortion advocates, pro-abortion legislators and @GovernorVA are horrifying indicators of the spreading of a culture of death in our society.
