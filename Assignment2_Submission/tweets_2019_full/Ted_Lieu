Today @HouseJudiciary held a hearing on the oversight of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). We must protect our national security. And we must comply with the Constitution. We must do both. https://t.co/DYHnwT2e7C
The Trump Administration is proposing a #DirtyWaterRule that would radically reinterpret Clean Water Act protections, virtually assuring extensive damage to rivers, streams, lakes, and more throughout the country. We must put #PeopleBeforePolluters and #ProtectOurWater. https://t.co/8Qr2fS4LPC
Trump's latest step in his efforts to target California is reprehensible and legally dubious. #ClimateChange is our greatest existential threat. We will fight to stop this Administration from wreaking havoc on our environment. https://t.co/1oPTbflWHI
It's critical that California be able to set higher emissions standards than the Federal government.

What's become clear is that Trump is harming California and is punishing our efforts to make the world a safe and livable place for future generations.
California’s ability to set stringent car emissions standards has put us at the forefront of developing fuel efficient cars &amp; reducing car pollution. From fires to droughts to flooding, our state &amp; the health of Californians are uniquely susceptible to impacts of climate change.
As the President visits #CA33 this week, he’s working simultaneously to destroy a critical part of our state’s efforts to combat climate change and protect public health.

As we learned with Mueller, witness testimony is critical to any investigation. Today on #ConstitutionDay, @HouseJudiciary is holding #CoreyLewandowski &amp; Trump accountable for their #CultureofCorruption. No one is above the law. The American people deserve truth &amp; accountability. https://t.co/KLLMXtGzlu
FACT: #Lewandowski was involved in Trump’s repeated obstruction of justice. Trump asked him twice to have Sessions limit the Mueller investigation. Discussed this and more with @MSNBC @HallieJackson. Watch here ⬇️ https://t.co/AMCKwV4g21

@realDonaldTrump knows this, and the @WhiteHouse is intent on preventing the American people from hearing the details.

The Trump Admin’s #PublicCharge rule is a cruel attack on immigrants families. Millions will now be faced with the choice of providing for their families or having a future in the US. We must stop this attack on our legal immigration system! #NoToPublicCharge #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/4CzlhaZ6dW
Joined @RepSwalwell &amp; @HouseJudiciary members in sending a letter to @USGAO urging an investigation of the improper detention of US citizens by @CBP &amp; @ICEgov. It's unconscionable that our govt would round up citizens, detain them, &amp; then try to deport them. We need answers ASAP. https://t.co/4AAmsbglkU
