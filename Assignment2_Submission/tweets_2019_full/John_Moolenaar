This continues the strong economic record of the past couple of years, with unemployment at record lows, and Michigan residents keeping more of their own money, which is always a good thing.
Tax reform has spurred developments including today’s, as businesses across mid and northern Michigan build new facilities and create more good-paying jobs.
Terrific news for Beaverton today! The federal government is investing $1.45 million in the community's opportunity zone which was created by the tax reform law I supported in 2017.

SOO LOCKS FUNDING MOVES FORWARD: Today, the Appropriations Committee passed legislation with $75.3 million for building a new lock at the Soo Locks. This has been a top priority of my work on the committee and it funds the construction of a new lock for the first time in decades! https://t.co/ciA9M1WLT4
While I have concerns about other parts of this large bill, especially any that might affect Michigan agriculture, I am optimistic that by working with the president as we have done, strong support for the GLRI will continue as we move toward a final bill that is signed into law.
As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have been working with my colleagues to build a strong bipartisan coalition of support for the GLRI including Republicans, Democrats, and President Trump. That is reflected in this new legislation which has full funding for the GLRI. https://t.co/VETJRjk8it
