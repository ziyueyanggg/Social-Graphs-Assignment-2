One of the greatest beneficiaries of the crisis on our southern border is the cartels charging up to $10k to smuggle people illegally into our country. The House took the steps to end these dangerous activities by passing my amendment to H.R. 2513. https://t.co/pN15YGs5cK https://t.co/0Kh223x5kB

As I stated this morning, I have a feeling of a lost opportunity to work in a #bipartisan manner and put forward legislation to make a real difference in the lives of the constituents in all of our districts. It is clear that H.R. 3 is not the solution. https://t.co/ejUuGWppOd

Congress shouldn't promote rhetoric that demonizes hardworking @CBP officers. It is important that 41 @HouseDemocrats voted alongside @HouseGOP tonight to commend these committed individuals who are responding to the humanitarian crisis on the border. https://t.co/FXWzhB98dF
As Congress considers the humanitarian crisis on the border, all of us should maintain civility when discussing @CBP &amp; @HHSGov staff who are doing their best to fulfill the mission Congress gave them.

As a teenager growing up  in Denton, Texas, I delivered pizzas, baled hay, and mowed lawns to pay for my education. Passing a federal minimum wage increase would eliminate such opportunities for future generations of Americans. https://t.co/oegTS2xnT4
Texas can't afford to lose more than 250,000 jobs if @HouseDemocrats pass their extreme minimum wage increase that we're considering today. When Congress should be focused on pro-growth policies, this bill would be detrimental to American families, workers, and entrepreneurs. https://t.co/VNMp5jXefA
Instead of obsessing over their hatred of @POTUS and his winning record, House Democrats should be willing to roll up their sleeves and get to work on issues that impact American families. I remain willing to collaborate with any and all Members of Congress to deliver results.
From record low unemployment to unprecedented investments in preventing HIV, sickle cell disease, and maternal mortality, @POTUS is delivering policy that helps Americans – of all races, ethnicities, religions, and political affiliations – expand their opportunities to succeed.
Today I returned home to attend Ross Perot's memorial service and couldn't make it back to the Capitol in time for votes. I would have voted NO on H.Res. 489, a bill so inappropriate that its title cannot be read aloud on the House Floor per @HouseDemocrats' own rules.
It's a privilege to join many fellow Texans and people from around the world today as we honor the life of Ross Perot. From unwavering support of American veterans to unmatched business acumen and generous philanthropy, he has left a profound legacy in North Texas and beyond.

Passing emergency aid was a step forward, but it's not a long-term solution. Congress must pass effective border security &amp; fix laws that incentivize illegal migration. Until then, Congress must ensure that @CBP &amp; all fed agencies are fully-equipped to handle the border crisis.
All people are worthy of human dignity &amp; wrongdoing should be brought to light. Officers who violate @CBP standards should be disciplined. 

At the same time, we can't forget that a majority of CBP officers are doing all they can to provide humanitarian support.
.@CBP undoubtedly is operating beyond capacity. In 10 trips to the border since 2014, I've never witnessed conditions in CBP processing facilities as crowded as those I saw last week. However, I have never seen anything close to what I've heard described by House Dems this week.
Last week, I joined President @realDonaldTrump at the White House as he announced his plans to expand Americans’ health care choices. Read more: https://t.co/fCd3rz6c6z (Official White House Photo by Joyce N. Boghosian) https://t.co/x5qewelqFj
Today I returned to southwest Texas to visit @CBP facilities on the southern border, where I witnessed a number of migrants entering the U.S. There is no question that Congress must act to end this security and humanitarian crisis.

This week I joined @USCPSC on the National Mall for a fiery demonstration on the danger of fireworks-related injuries. As Americans prepare to celebrate the Fourth of July, please take proper precautions to keep yourself and others safe. https://t.co/lLCGffmqXb
To save lives, Congress must act to fix our nation’s broken laws. We must act to stop coyotes from profiting on children's dangerous trips the border. And, we must act to ensure that U.S. foreign aid dollars are helping Central Americans to thrive in their home communities.
All deaths on the southern border are tragic. According to @CBP, on average 357 people have died along our southern border each year since 1998. During the Obama Admin, 3,275 people died trying to cross into the U.S. Since President Trump took office, 581 people have died.
After @HouseGOP Members asked Democrats more than 80 times to allow a vote on bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate 84-8, the House finally has voted to deliver desperately-needed humanitarian aid to the border - sending the bill to @POTUS' desk. https://t.co/uN3cSyrQSv
It's wrong that @GovAbbott must bear the federal responsibility of providing support on the TX/Mexico border at expense to TX taxpayers. At @RulesReps, I offered an amendment with @RepChipRoy to reimburse Texas for the $800 million our state has spent filling in for Congress. https://t.co/8cvhSiC9HI
.@RulesDemocrats just blocked my motion to keep the House in session until we send a bill to @POTUS that delivers the humanitarian aid that is desperately needed on the southern border. Congress must finish its work. https://t.co/kOnKDMRimG
I’m joining @TeamCavuto in a few moments to discuss the humanitarian and security crisis on the southern border. Tune in to catch our conversation.
If we want to end the crisis on our southern border, Congress must pass legislative fixes to provide border security that @POTUS will sign. 

We also should use foreign aid to address the conditions in Central America that spur migrants to leave. MORE: https://t.co/9u4AvSjQDm
As I told the @startelegram in February, Democrats who came with me to the Homestead ORR shelter were more interested in holding a press conference than seeing the truth about ORR shelters - it was like we were on different planets. https://t.co/T9ZHkr11l8
It's disappointing that @HouseDemocrats would rather perpetuate their hatred of the President than work on real solutions that will end this crisis. This year, they've voted 17 times to block humanitarian aid that is desperately needed.
Thanks to our work in @HouseCommerce, today HHS provides medical care, mental health care, and additional important services - such as screening for human trafficking vulnerability - to all unaccompanied minors in ORR care.
Unfortunately that wasn’t always the case. In 2014, after President Obama’s DACA policy incentivized people to bring children on the perilous trip to the border, I was shocked by the conditions I found in shelters. Under the Obama Admin, HHS wasn't even providing medical care.
.@HHSgov is tasked with caring for unaccompanied children transferred from @CBP. As I've seen firsthand during many trips to shelters, HHS ORR personnel work hard to provide quality, compassionate care to children who cross the border without legal status.
We cannot forget that Democrats' empty promises of unconditional amnesty have created the crisis on our southern border by encouraging coyotes to use children as pawns in human trafficking schemes. It's not just wrong, it's inhumane to incentivize this heinous practice.
With @POTUS' signature, the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2019 - which includes my MISSION Zero Act - is the law of the land. Read my statement on this bipartisan law: https://t.co/JCzQyLqrrX
As I wrote in @WashTimes back in 2006, price transparency gives patients more control of their health care. I’m glad that President @realDonaldTrump is taking action, and Congress should follow through with legislative solutions. https://t.co/50EZ7RdlQA
Every day, I hear from North Texans &amp; Americans from around the country that the health care system is too complicated and too expensive. This afternoon I’m joining @POTUS as he signs an executive order that will increase transparency and lower costs for American patients.
A year after the SUPPORT Act passed the House, I am grateful that Congress' comprehensive solution to fight our nation's opioid crisis is making a difference in Americans' lives. It was a privilege to help steward this lifesaving law across the finish line. https://t.co/c3n0xNISqd
As I told @dallasnews, Democrats continue to kick solutions to the humanitarian crisis on the southern border further down the road. As of this week, they have voted 17 times to block aid that is desperately needed. This isn't just wrong, it's inhumane. https://t.co/7GgaoN9g9s
Today the @HouseCommerce Health Subcommittee is holding a hearing on expanding access to health care in the U.S. Territories. Read my opening remarks and learn more: https://t.co/zVOzAKAoxn
On #WorldSickleCellDay2019, I reaffirm my commitment to support Americans who are developing innovative treatments - and even a cure - for this painful disease. It's a privilege to work alongside @RepDannyDavis to pass legislative solutions. https://t.co/yR7TQHZaiW
In 1865, Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger of the Union Army arrived in Galveston, TX to announce the end of the Civil War and - at last - enforce the #EmancipationProclamation. Today I join my fellow Texans in celebrating #Juneteenth as the end of slavery in Texas and our nation.
From expanding access to proposing innovative solutions, @POTUS is working to lower prescription drug costs for the American people. Congress should be willing to work alongside President Trump to deliver results. https://t.co/AehEjUtqpp
Tonight the House passed H.R. 3253 - bipartisan @HouseCommerce legislation that will strengthen our nation's health care safety net. It extends vital Medicaid programs, bolsters access to mental health care, and supports individuals with chronic conditions &amp; disabilities.
Congratulations to Mayor Eric Johnson, who was sworn in as Dallas’ 60th leader this morning. I am looking forward to working alongside Mayor Johnson to serve North Texans.
#FathersDay recognizes the importance that fathers play in their children’s lives. I hope all North Texas dads have a great day.
As we enter hurricane season and encounter severe weather this summer, make sure to plan ahead for any emergency you may face. @FEMA can help you #BeInformed: https://t.co/r6GDJQ40Pn https://t.co/RkqCuhcypL
Since 1916, Americans have celebrated June 14 as #FlagDay - a tribute to the Stars and Stripes. More than a century later, we continue this important tradition. https://t.co/fQb78U6YLf
It is important that @POTUS is taking action to expand Americans’ health care choices and help small businesses thrive. Alongside President Trump, Congress must continue to address the cost and complexity of our nation’s health care system. https://t.co/ZXaKQdnAMi
While House Democrats and the media continue to discuss the President's answer to a hypothetical question, let's not forget that Democrats accepted and shared a dossier from a foreign ex-spy during the 2016 election. My statement: https://t.co/SKcpA7If9r
Two years after the senseless attack on @HouseGOP Members at a baseball field, it is a relief to see my friend Whip @SteveScalise thriving and fighting for the American people. https://t.co/ApvzoLMhoJ
Today we celebrate 244 years of excellence at @USArmy. #ArmyBDay https://t.co/3TXxx43qch
Just the facts --&gt; If Democrats implemented their extreme government health care takeover, 13+ million Texans would lose their private health insurance. https://t.co/boogspmprm
My bipartisan work with @RepDannyDavis to invest in a cure for #SickleCellDisease shows what Congress can accomplish for the American people. I’m grateful that our amendment to support @CDCgov’s efforts to help patients with Sickle Cell Disease passed with overwhelming support. https://t.co/Lwg8V8t9vt
Last week, I had the privilege of joining @GovAbbott and North Texas leader Blake Pyron of @Blakessnowshack for the signing of Texas S.B. 753, which will ensure that each person's inherent value is recognized. Read more: https://t.co/RufxtPzETp https://t.co/ll8EgHRs5V
Congress must continue to support the brave men &amp; women who selflessly ran toward danger on 9/11. I co-sponsored HR 1327 to permanently authorize the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, and I'm grateful that @HouseJudiciary advanced this important bill today. #Renew911VCF
This morning, @WaysMeansCmte is holding a hearing on Democrats’ government-run, single-payer health care plan. 

How long will it take for Chairman @FrankPallone and @EnergyCommerce, the committee of jurisdiction, to hold a hearing on @HouseDemocrats' extreme gov't takeover plan?
It was a pleasure to meet @MedlinMS students at the @uscapitol this afternoon. Welcoming young North Texans to the Capitol is one of the best parts of my job. https://t.co/fInIkK3Tp6
Taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for partisan interference in litigation. Tonight all 8 @RulesDemocrats voted to block my amendment to prohibit the Office of General Counsel from hiring lawyers or consultants who lobby Congress to represent the House.
https://t.co/PA4IUjbc6q
Thanks again to @kilmeade for inviting me on #TheBrianKilmeadeShow to correct the record on the humanitarian and security crisis on the southern border. It’s time for Congress to deliver effective border security and real reform. Catch up here: https://t.co/A0OYk1JI8R
Vaccines are important tools that protect Americans from preventable suffering. I’m grateful to @SecAzar and @POTUS for their leadership on this critical issue. https://t.co/4gOsgx1uAV
Thanks to @MariaBartiromo for bringing attention to the critical need for effective border security and additional resources as enormous numbers of migrants enter the U.S. each day. Watch our full conversation: https://t.co/EWVICbaffZ
#FBF to December 2010, when five Senate Democrats sank the DREAM Act. Fast forward nearly a decade to this week and @HouseDemocrats have advanced H.R. 6 - a bill that has next to no chance of becoming law and is not a valid solution to the border crisis. https://t.co/8GcIrdrOYp
