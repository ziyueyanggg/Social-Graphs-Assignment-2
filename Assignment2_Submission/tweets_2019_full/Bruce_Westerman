While we're at it, why don't we vote to pass USMCA? Or secure the border? Or lower prescription drug costs? Or fund the government?

Maybe if @SpeakerPelosi spent less time on impeachment inquiries and more time on bipartisan bills, Congress could actually get things done. https://t.co/QFHrYox6iF
I agree! Forest management doesn't have to be a partisan issue. When it comes to protecting our forests against wildfires, diseases, and pests, we should all be on the same team. https://t.co/o93hSOeEfE
So what do we do? Start by recognizing that scientific practices like thinning allow trees to thrive and mitigate fire risk.

As urban areas continue growing larger and closer to forests, we can't deny the issues at stake. Sound forest management must be our future.
Refusing to manage forests isn't environmentally friendly, it's just bad science. Dead, diseased trees are not only releasing carbon into the air, but they're also posing a greater fire risk.

Rather than acknowledging this, congressional Dems continue pushing impractical plans.
Take, for example, this NYT story: "That area hasn’t seen any fire history since the 1940s,” Captain Volmer [a fire behavior analyst at Cal Fire] said, adding that the vegetation in that area is extremely dense, old and dry.

https://t.co/6NsNA1pDRO
During horrible natural disasters like the current fires in California, environmental activists immediately blame the GOP.

What they fail to mention are bills like the Resilient Federal Forests Act, which would use scientific forest management to fortify forests against fires.
Al Baghdadi was responsible for terror and destruction in the Middle East and beyond, and the confirmation of his death is a huge victory against ISIS. I’m grateful to every service member who risked their life administering justice to an enemy of the United States.

The House is voting now on raising the minimum wage to $15/hr. 

This means that some employees would receive pay raises. But @USCBO estimates that 3.7 million people would lose their jobs as a result.

It's an irresponsible bill that hurts small businesses and entry-level jobs.
