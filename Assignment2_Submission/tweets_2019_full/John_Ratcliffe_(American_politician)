Since the ICIG has no evidence whatsoever about the relationship and contacts between the whistleblower and Schiff’s staff, the investigation has to get that information from other fact witnesses. Who also happen to be running the investigation.
@JonPhil22539890 @Peoples_Pundit @RepAdamSchiff And you’d all be correct
So Schiff claims outrage and alleges a White House "cover-up" to not notify Congress of the whistleblower complaint when his own staff knew and advised the whistleblower before the complaint was filed? Yeah, sure, this isn’t a sham.  

https://t.co/GE6bmDnXYB

In their desire to undo the 2016 election and destroy President Trump, Democrats have today unequivocally and irreparably harmed our national security and compromised an important ally. Instead of forming an impeachment line, Democrats should consider forming an apology line.
Whether it’s impeachment by collusion, by conspiracy, by the Emoluments Clause, or by the President using a Sharpie on a weather map, the Democrats are willing to stretch their credibility to any length to be the “Party of Impeachment.”

On top of this, there was exculpatory information that was used to open the investigation that was never presented to the FISA court at all.

It’s ironic that Nadler is still accusing @realDonaldTrump of lying when he’s the only one not telling the truth. Yesterday Mueller said there was no collusion, but Democrats are still looking for some foothold to start impeachment proceedings. https://t.co/8wU4ZkTp6U
Mueller put a stake in the heart of the collusion conspiracy narrative when he confirmed – again – that there was insufficient evidence to charge a crime. There’s either evidence sufficient to charge a crime or there isn’t – end of story. https://t.co/dxaJSQWYgd

It's beyond dispute that the Obama admin used surveillance tools to spy on the Trump campaign. But did they just use those tools, or did they abuse them?
