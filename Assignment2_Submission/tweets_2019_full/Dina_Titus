We are not powerless in the face of the gun violence epidemic. It’s far past time for President Trump and Senator McConnell to stop acting as such and to start working in good faith to help save lives.
In the United States of America, when someone decides to attend a concert, their parents should not have to worry about whether they will come home.
On this second anniversary of the darkest day in our city’s history, our community comes together to remember the victims and survivors. We're reminded of the courageous first responders, medical professionals, and ordinary citizens who came to their aid in a time of tragedy.
On this solemn second anniversary of the #1October mass shooting, #TeamTitus joined @ClarkCountyNV and our community this morning to remember the 58 innocent lives lost. Together, we are #VegasStronger. https://t.co/essfDpxxfZ

Big news! The House just passed the SAFE Banking Act to allow banks and credit unions to work with cannabis businesses.

Nevada is proof that the era of marijuana prohibition is over. It's time for @realDonaldTrump and the U.S. Senate to start acting like it.
The Trump Administration must immediately release the full whistleblower complaint and allow the whistleblower to testify before Congress as the law requires. The American people deserve to fully know the extent to which President Trump has failed to uphold his oath of office.
The call summary clearly shows that President Trump asked the leader of a foreign government to interfere in our election. This profoundly un-American and lawless action demands an impeachment inquiry.
