Witness at W&amp;M Cmte hearing just said that bureaucrats in Washington will decide who is eligible for treatments and that individual choice in healthcare would be diminished under #MedicareForAll. Do @HouseDemocrats really want a one-size-fits-all Hcare system controlled in D.C.?
Today, the House Ways &amp; Means Cmte will hold a hearing on #MedicareForAll. Americans want to protect what works and improve what doesn't. M4A would take away private plans and force everyone on gov healthcare. No choice, longer waits, &amp; broken promises to seniors. Bad policy!
Each day we delay USMCA, U.S. workers and industry lose opportunity.  When NAFTA was written, the internet wasn't major part of commerce. USMCA creates new standards for digital trade. Let's bring trade with Mexico and Canada into the 21st century by passing #USMCA now!
75 years ago today, America &amp; its allies invaded Normandy to liberate Europe from the evil of Nazi tyranny. These men changed the course of history. We honor their memory and will continue their fight for liberty for future generations!
