The death of Jeffrey #Epstein does not end the fight for justice for his victims. They deserve closure, and the public needs answers as to why a prolific child molester got a slap on the wrist instead of a long prison sentence. We cannot allow this to happen again.

It was as clear to me then as it is now that recognizing this horrific crime against humanity is a moral imperative. Today, I voted to formally recognize the #ArmenianGenocide. Through education &amp; accountability, we can pursue justice for the victims &amp; prevent future atrocities.
