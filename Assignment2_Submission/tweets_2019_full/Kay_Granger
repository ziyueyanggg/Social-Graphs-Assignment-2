I look forward working alongside my colleagues in the House and Senate and with the Trump Administration to fix the appropriations process and advance conservative values in the 116th Congress.
I am humbled by the support of my colleagues &amp; excited to get to work reforming the @HouseAppropsGOP into one that prioritizes Members &amp; delivers results for the American people. In an era of divided government, our committee will play a vital role in advancing GOP priorities.
I offer my condolences to the entire Bush family on the loss of former President George H.W. Bush. He led a life of service, and his leadership made the world safer and freer. He led his life with such dignity and honor -- we could all learn from his example.
The hard work to reform the committee begins today.  I am looking forward to fighting for conservative values and holding the Democrats accountable in the 116th Congress.
It is an enormous honor to be able to serve as the Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee.  I appreciate the vote of confidence from the Steering Committee and all of the help and support I’ve received from so many Members.

While Congress has fought over some things, we've also worked in a bipartisan way to get the people's work done. It’s a record of results that’s making our country stronger and more prosperous, and I hope you’ll share it with your friends if they ask: “what has Congress done?”
CONSERVATIVE JUDGES: The Senate has confirmed President Trump’s judicial nominees at a historic pace: 84 total, including 29 circuit judges, 53 district court judges, and Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.
OBAMACARE RELIEF: Repealed the individual mandate tax that forced Americans to buy something many didn’t want or couldn’t afford, and ended IPAB.

ENERGY: Opened Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), one of the largest untapped conventional oilfields in North America, to help keep energy affordable.
MILITARY FUNDING: After many years of neglecting our national security, our troop readiness, and the critical maintenance of our defense infrastructure, we’ve provided record funding to @DeptofDefense, including the largest pay increase in nine years.
TAX REFORM: Reformed America’s tax code for the first time in 31 years, putting more money in the pockets of American families and creating more opportunity for them and their children.
PREVENTING MASS SHOOTINGS: Enacted Fix NICS and STOP School Violence Act to help protect the American people from mass shootings and fix the broken background check system.
OPIOID LEGISLATION: Combating the nation’s worst public health crisis with a package of proposals to fight a widespread epidemic, including stopping fentanyl at the border and spurring development of new non-addictive painkillers.

Since last January, we’ve passed historic tax reform, provided massive regulatory relief for businesses, and boosted our military with the biggest increase in funding in more than 15 years.  But our record of success is much lengthier than that. Here are some of the highlights:

A copy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers October 3, 2018 statement can be found here: https://t.co/OVmuKiOtFi cc: @USACE_FortWorth
Nor is it a secret that as a result of recent Hurricane recovery and relief efforts being stretched thin over the past two years, the current federal budget is step-funding (using incremental appropriation) for its other flood-control and water infrastructure projects.
Clearly, it is no secret that such funding will be spread over several years to match the progress of the state and local government partners as in the pending completion by TxDOT on the project's new bridges.
The Trinity River Vision flood control project is both strongly supported by the Corps and has received Congressional approval (2016) for matching federal funding ($526 million).
This statement from the Corps is appreciated as it clarifies any misleading interpretations caused by Wednesday's McClatchy Fort Worth Star-Telegram article.
In the October 3, 2018 statement released by Corps, they declare: "The Trinity River Vision/Central City project continues to embody the vision of safety for the people of North Texas through the flood risk management and ecosystem improvement missions of the Corps."
Today, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers once again strongly affirmed its commitment to the Trinity River Vision flood control project and acknowledged that it is authorized for federal funding in this coming year's 2019 Energy and Water Development Act.

It has been the honor of my life to represent @NASFortWorthJRB, the service members, our veterans community, &amp; the thousands of constituents who skillfully build the very equipment that this nation counts on to keep us safe, including the F-35 and V-22.
Finally, this is a bill for Fort Worth.
It is critical that the @DeptofDefense has predictable and timely funding so that Mattis and our military leadership can plan with accurate funding levels.  For the first time in nine years, we have done just that.
It is our most basic responsibility to ensure our troops are ready to defend our nation, and that they have the very best training and the most effective weapons available.
I worked in lockstep with @DeptofDefense Secretary Mattis to ensure this bill provides the critical-funding needed to implement the new National Defense Strategy, and to continue rebuilding our armed forces.
After many years of neglecting our national security, our troop readiness, and the critical maintenance of our defense infrastructure, my legislation builds on the significant progress we started last year.
