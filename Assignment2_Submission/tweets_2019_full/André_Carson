I just voted to terminate President Trump's Border Emergency. 

This #FakeEmergency is nothing but a scheme to build his ineffective wall by diverting money from important military projects. It's not only xenophobic, it's fiscally irresponsible and an insult to our troops.

At our @HouseIntel hearing, I questioned Acting DNI Joseph Maguire about the need to submit whistleblower complaints to Congress, as the law clearly states. This disregard for the law is one of the most startling aspects of this story, and it can't happen again. Watch: https://t.co/fh9A5wXYKc
That's why our @HouseIntel hearing today is so important. Read the complaint here:

https://t.co/TWMMgP7pEI
Now that the whistleblower's complaint has been released, all Americans can see in plain view the extent of the Administration's wrongdoing. What's written can't be muddied by gaslighting, false equivalencies, or spin from the President and his allies. The abuse is clear as day.

I have already voted for @RepAlGreen's  impeachment resolutions, and now, reports that he urged the President of #Ukraine to investigate his political opponent only strengthen my conviction that Congress must act. It may be the only way to save our Democracy.
Just so we're clear -- I have supported an impeachment inquiry for some time because it has become increasingly obvious to me that this President has flagrantly abused the power of the Oval Office, without regard for the Constitution he swore to uphold and defend.

America is in the midst of an epidemic of violence -- fueled by hate and exacerbated by easy access to weapons of war. We need bold leadership to stop it. This President is incapable of bringing about solutions because he is part of the problem.
President Trump's remarks are the bare minimum. He simply paid lip service. There was no real plan for substantive reform. Nor did he take any responsibility for his own reckless words and actions that incite far-right extremists to commit these unspeakable horrors.
I'm watching the developing situation in Kashmir with deep concern. Each state’s autonomy must be respected, and the U.S. should play a lead role in maintaining the delicate balance there. Border disputes and very important counterterrorism and proliferation concerns are at play.
My heart breaks for the victims of the shooting in El Paso, Texas and their loved ones. Though we don’t know all the details of this tragedy, one thing is clear: Far too many of our fellow Americans are falling victim to gun violence, and we must take bold action to save lives.
Very pleased that my Senate colleagues passed a resolution honoring the @AmericanLegion's centennial! This Indy-based org deserves to be recognized for its ongoing work to serve our veterans and our communities. I'll be introducing companion legislation in the House soon.

#ICYMI: At @HouseIntel's hearing with Director #Mueller, I asked about the Mueller Report findings on President Trump's Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort. I believe he betrayed our country through his shady dealings with Russian oligarchs. #MuellerHearings https://t.co/xP3TUyH9rg

My committee, @HouseIntel, will be holding its hearing with Director Mueller beginning at noon today. I'm looking forward to learning more from our expert witness about the systematic attack on our Democracy. We must #FollowTheFacts to prevent it from ever happening again.
Meanwhile, our deficit is poised to hit a record high thanks in part to the reckless #GOPTaxScam, which gave yet another tax cut to the wealthiest among us. Time and again, this administration shows they are crafting policy for big-money special interests, and not #ForThePeople.
I'm appalled by the #Trump Administration's proposed change that could slash SNAP benefits for around 3 million people. This President only seems to care about cost-cutting and fiscal responsibility when it will harm the most vulnerable among us.
I proudly stand with our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico demanding decency, accountability and transparency from their elected officials. @RicardoRossello has betrayed the public trust and must resign. https://t.co/w59ak3qN9d

We must also address other known vulnerabilities, like flight deck safety. Despite Congress passing my provisions requiring secondary cockpit barriers on new airplanes, the FAA is failing to act in a timely manner.  We can't delay this reform when lives are at stake.
My committee, @TransportDems, is holding an important aviation safety hearing on the 737 MAX 8’s recent crashes, where we heard heartbreaking testimony from victims’ families. It’s unacceptable that known flaws were not disclosed nor fixed. We must do better.
I spoke on the House floor urging passage of my amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act with @RepStefanik that protects the American supply chain from threats to our national security. I also praised the long-overdue steps taken in this bill to tackle domestic terrorism. https://t.co/F7J4HUVic0

President Trump’s remarks telling my colleagues to “go back where they came from” further reveals his narrow-minded ideas about who belongs in this country. They are principled Americans who belong right where they are — in Congress — pushing back against his dangerous agenda.
ICE is planning to begin widespread raids in major cities across the country beginning Sunday.

Today, the House passed a permanent reauthorization of the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund, which will ensure continued care for the first responders who saved lives at Ground Zero. We must never turn our back on these heroes. I urge the Senate to pass this important bill swiftly.
Team Carson was honored to take part in @IMPDEast's Community Day -- a celebration put on by the department that features food, fun and the chance to connect with officers. This is a great example of meaningful law enforcement engagement with the community. Thanks, IMPD! https://t.co/MRLxbobffZ
The bill achieves this by considering immigrants' applications based on when they applied, not their country of origin. While this legislation doesn't address everything that is wrong with our immigration system, it's a meaningful reform -- one of many we should consider.
Pleased the House passed legislation I cosponsored to help address our broken immigration system. The "Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act" (H.R. 1044) will remove per-country limits for employment-based immigrants, helping more highly skilled immigrants get visas faster.
The GOP's lawsuit, Texas v US, is a dangerous attempt to completely overturn the #AffordableCareAct.

Great news! The @USDOL has awarded a $1.5 million grant to @RecycleForce to help expand its efforts to provide jobs and workforce training for people recently released from prison. I wrote a letter supporting the org's funding request, and I'm pleased it has received this boost.
If these reports are true, the agents should be fired or suspended indefinitely. They have no business caring for the most vulnerable among us, and are an embarrassment to principled public servants everywhere. We desperately need immigration reform built on compassion, not hate.
I am disgusted by reports of a secret Facebook group that CBP agents are using to spew vile filth about the migrants in their care and other public officials. It's another sad example of the total lack of compassion or professionalism driving the policies at our southern border.

We can't sit by while this fundamental freedom is stolen by those who want to silence our voices. That's why I'm supporting the Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R.4), which will stop this harmful voter suppression. We must protect the power of the vote #ForThePeople.
But on this day in 2013, the #Shelby v. Holder Supreme Court decision weakened this landmark law. Since then, we have witnessed early voting periods shortened, voter rolls purged, and nearly 1,000 polling places closed.
The Voting Rights Act, passed in 1965, was secured after decades of tireless and courageous activism. This achievement was not won without a struggle. People risked their lives, and some died, to challenge unjust disenfranchisement and ensure the right to vote. https://t.co/BELB3krqPO

Threats of mass deportations this weekend, which terrified immigrant communities across America, was not a solution. It was a callous attempt to fan the flames of fear and xenophobia. Our immigration policy must respect every person's basic rights and inherent humanity.
If President Trump wants Congress to take the lead on immigration reform, then he should immediately support the House's appropriations bill this week that protects vulnerable children, funds alternatives to immigrant detention, and affirms the truth that #FamiliesBelongTogether.
And a special thanks to Trustee @Annette92J for helping to make this day a big success!
