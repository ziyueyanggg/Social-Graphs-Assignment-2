‚Üí Harass Trump some more with an impeachment resolution that failed 332-95

House passed a bill doubling minimum wage. Big increase would eliminate many jobs and harm small family businesses. 

However, there's plenty of evidence illegal immigration harms low-wage workers the most. If Democrats really cared, they'd help us end unfair labor competition.
More than 2 years of impeachment hysteria ended with an embarrassing vote for Democrats yesterday that liberal media, which has fueled the frenzy, largely ignored. No surprises there. 

Far left forced impeachment vote that failed. Many Democrats voted against. That's all, folks.
