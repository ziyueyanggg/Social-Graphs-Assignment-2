As always, trust but verify and I am going to continue pushing PG&amp;E to restore power for everyone in our district as soon as it’s possible to do so safely. This is still too long for folks to go without power and water and updates have been few and far between.
Just got another update from PG&amp;E. They expect all counties in our district to have at least 75% of the power restored by tonight. Most of the remaining residents will have power by tomorrow night with a small % that may be delayed because of damage sustained by the #KincadeFire.
Good news, per the @sonomasheriff some Evacuation Orders have been lifted for the City of Santa Rosa and Sonoma County. Some areas have been downgraded to an Evacuation Warning due to risks from the #KincadeFire so please remain vigilant. More info here: https://t.co/lnssWQSFdb https://t.co/CnkkCLuuVZ

Please know I will continue working to keep you informed to the best of my ability and will keep working to ensure we have consistent and safe power. The current situation is obviously unacceptable.
People are understandably and rightfully frustrated power has been out and information has not been clear. PG&amp;E said some folks were never re-energized because of heavy wind damage to power lines during the most recent wind event or because of fire damage from the #KincadeFire.
