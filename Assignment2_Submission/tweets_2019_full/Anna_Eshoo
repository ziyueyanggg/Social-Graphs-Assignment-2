I thought of my parents and grandparents yesterday as the House voted to formally recognize the Armenian Genocide. This resolution honors and commemorates my ancestors and all those who perished in the first genocide of the 20th century. https://t.co/YlWssPpOZJ
This resolution not only honors and commemorates my ancestors who perished but all those who were lost in the first genocide of the 20th Century. #ArmenianGenocide
49 U.S. states and over 2 dozen countries, including 14 NATO allies, have passed Genocide Resolutions. It‚Äôs time for Congress to act. There is an historic parallel today as Turkey is once again engaging in ethnic cleansing, this time against the Kurds in Syria.
Members of my own family were among those murdered, and my parents fled with my grandparents to America. What all of the persecuted had in common was that they were Christians.
Between 1915 and 1923, 1.5 million Armenians, and hundreds of thousands of Assyrians, Greeks, Syriacs, Arameans, Maronites, and other Christians were systematically slaughtered at the hands of the Ottoman Empire.
Today the House will vote on a resolution affirming the U.S. record on the Armenian Genocide. I‚Äôve been waiting for this moment since I first came to Congress 27 years ago.

The courts have consistently upheld the rights of migrants in detention, and my hope is that they will overturn the Trump Administration‚Äôs inhumane rule. https://t.co/QqkQV7wiuF
After visiting detention centers at the southern border in July, it is clear the Trump Administration‚Äôs policies have exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. Today‚Äôs rule is yet another action to punish refugees.
No family, and certainly no child, should ever be subjected to indefinite detention, and this move by the Administration will create even more suffering.
The Trump Administration‚Äôs new rule to detain immigrant families indefinitely flies in the face of 20 years of judicial oversight to protect the human rights and dignity of families.
I applaud Planned Parenthood for their unfailing commitment to provide the best care and medical counsel available to their patients. Unlike the Trump Administration, they prioritize patients over politics.
Title X is the only federal grant program dedicated to providing family planning services to low-income and otherwise underserved communities. The Administration‚Äôs ill-begotten rules target and will hurt the most vulnerable women in our country.
The Trump Administration is reaping the discord they sow. By forcing a gag rule on health care providers that use #TitleX funding, the Administration is robbing nearly 1.5 million women of affordable, quality, and lifesaving care.

Today we remember the 1.5 million lives lost during the Armenian Genocide. We can never allow time to diminish the cruelty and violence perpetuated by the Ottoman Empire against Armenians, Assyrians, Greeks, and other minorities. We carry the victims' history &amp; honor their legacy
This #EarthDay, let‚Äôs look at the facts. A recent study says there‚Äôs a 99.9999% chance that humans are the cause of global warming. Our actions have consequences, and Congress must pass comprehensive legislation to protect our planet for future generations https://t.co/7tjAhdDhbc
Deeply saddened by the heinous attacks against Christians as they celebrated Easter and tourists in Sri Lanka. My heartfelt condolences to all those affected by this senseless violence.
Bravo to the Coast Guard for their bravery and heroism. They executed an amazing rescue under difficult conditions to save two lives. Thank you for your service! https://t.co/4A4A0UoFtN

Bravo to Nathan Tan on earning a Silver Medal Congressional Award. His community service as a Boy Scout Senior Patrol Leader, participating in local clean-ups, and learning about the history and environment of our District is exemplary. Congratulations, Nathan! https://t.co/tFq2ISpBxu
On #TaxDay 2019, I wonder if President Trump has filed his tax returns just as millions of Americans have. The House passed my bill requiring him and all future presidents to release their tax returns. The American people deserve transparency.
My heart is heavy as are the hearts of millions around the world to see the 850 year old Cathedral of Notre Dame engulfed in flames. May the people of the world work with the people of France to rebuild it.
The House passed legislation during the first #100DaysForThePeople to:
 
‚Ä¢Fight corruption #ForThePeopleAct
‚Ä¢Close the gender pay gap #PaycheckFairnessAct
‚Ä¢Restore Net Neutrality #SaveTheNetAct 
‚Ä¢Ensure background checks #HR8
 
‚ÄúI've got new rules, I count 'em üòé‚Äù - @DUALIPA
Across America, 86% of the American people‚ÄîDemocrats, Republicans, Independents‚Äîsupport #NetNeutrality. Proud to pass the #SaveTheNet Act today to stop Internet Service Providers from throttling, blocking, and paid prioritization. https://t.co/WRyIpGbtac
The #SaveTheNet Act will:
 
‚úÖRestore popular, bipartisan #NetNeutrality protections
 
‚úÖPromote a free &amp; open internet
 
‚úÖEmpower the FCC to be the ‚Äòcop on the beat‚Äô to ensure the internet remains open &amp; free
 
Proud to be a net neutrality warrior &amp; vote on the bill this week!
The legacy left by Sec. Nielsen? Thousands of children inhumanely separated from their families. The new DHS Secretary must address the humanitarian crisis at our border, not add to the chaos and cruelty. https://t.co/FN7QnTksbP
From 2014 to 2016, programs funded by #VAWA provided legal assistance to an average of 28,553 victims of domestic and sexual violence every 6 months. I voted today to continue this service and create new programs for survivors by reauthorizing #VAWA4ALL
The Violence Against Women Act has helped survivors of domestic &amp; sexual violence through legal resources, housing, &amp; health care for 25 years. Today the House passed an updated #VAWA after Republicans shamefully allowed it to expire last December. https://t.co/bKsowxbLuz

The House just passed a resolution condemning the Trump Administration‚Äôs recent actions to seek the invalidation of every provision of the #AffordableCareAct. We will fight this Administration‚Äôs sabotage and do everything to protect, defend, and improve the #ACA.
A Joint Session of Congress met today and welcomed @NATO Secretary General @jensstoltenberg to underscore the critical importance of the most consequential alliance established post WWII that has successfully kept the peace since its inception 70 years ago. #NATO
Today is the day women‚Äôs wages catch up to what men were paid in the previous year. The Senate must join the House in passing the #PaycheckFairnessAct so every American receives equal pay for equal work. #EqualPayDay
My thanks to the over 3,200 people who participated in last week's Tele-Town Halls. I will continue to call into every community in our Congressional District, so stay tuned for future calls. Listen to past Town Halls and sign up for future events here! https://t.co/JsNupwLdS2
Today I voted to reject the President‚Äôs ban on transgender troops in the military. The brave men and women who serve our country to protect our freedoms should never be subjected to such bigotry. #ProtectTransTroops #TransVisibilityWeek
‚ÄúThe equivalent of a nuclear bomb fell on our country when the president said what he said this week,‚Äù Representative Anna G. Eshoo said Wednesday as her House subcommittee began pushing through health care legislation. ‚ÄúThis is deadly serious.‚Äù https://t.co/nAtZwc7lau
On average, a woman makes only 80 cents for every dollar earned by her white male counterpart. Help is on the way! The House passed the #PaycheckFairnessAct today, requiring companies to prove that pay disparities exist for legitimate reasons not based on gender alone.

March is #WomensHistoryMonth! 2019 has brought 131 women to serve in Congress‚Äîthe largest number in U.S. history, and we stand on the shoulders of women who fought for equality and access to opportunity. Jeannette Rankin was one such woman, the first elected to the House in 1916 https://t.co/oWOlrxn2ea

It‚Äôs hard to believe that 29 states allow housing and employment discrimination based on sexual orientation &amp; 30 states lack non-discrimination laws for gender identity. I'm cosponsoring the #EqualityAct to protect the civil rights of LGBT people across every state in our country

15 governors and the American Medical Association have voiced their opposition to the policy. It‚Äôs clear Trump‚Äôs move will harm public health. We must #SaveTitleX
The Trump Administration is pushing a reckless policy that threatens essential Title X health care services by limiting the providers who can participate in the program. This will severely restrict Americans from accessing basic health care.
Title X funding provides access to essential services, including breast &amp; cervical cancer screenings, affordable birth control, STI tests, family planning services and other critically important healthcare services for 4 million Americans, with not one cent used to fund abortions

I‚Äôm following the testimony of Michael Cohen closely. He has confirmed that Donald Trump knew about Julian Assange‚Äôs plans to release stolen emails during the 2016 campaign. The truth matters, and this Congress is dedicated to transparency and upholding the Rule of Law.
For the first time in over a decade The House will take up gun safety reform, and I will vote to pass #HR8 to strengthen the background check system and close dangerous gun sale loopholes. Thank you to @MomsDemand for your fearless work to end gun violence. You inspire me! https://t.co/eyqcK9mSbD
The votes are in. The House has overturned the President‚Äôs unconstitutional emergency declaration. A majority of Americans oppose the declaration, and nearly 60 national security advisers have spoken out against it. It‚Äôs time to end the #FakeEmergency
The U.S. Constitution is clear‚ÄîArticle One states that Congress controls the power of the purse. Today I will vote to uphold the Constitution by preventing the President from unlawfully taking money that Congress already appropriated. Congress &amp; The People do not support the wall
When the Supreme Court gutted key parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, it gave way to greater discrimination and the denial of the sacred right to vote. I‚Äôm very proud to be an original cosponsor of HR 4, The Voting Rights Advancement Act, to protect voters and #RestoreTheVote

Broadband providers should not be allowed to block websites they may not like, or discriminate against services and content that compete against their own. Today @EnergyCommerce held a hearing about the importance of restoring strong #NetNeutrality protections for all Americans.
For too long unreasonable forces have prevented serious consideration of virtually any gun legislation in Congress no matter how common-sense it is. That era is over. Today @HouseJudiciary is holding a hearing to address gun violence in America #TakingAction #EndGunViolence
Next week the Health Subcommittee will hold a legislative hearing on proposals to undo the Trump Administration's sabotage of the ACA. 
https://t.co/Jhu8FeULU6
Health care was the single most important issue to voters in the 2018 election, yet the #ACA is still under attack nearly ten years after the landmark bill was signed into law.
Today the @EnergyCommerce Health Subcommittee is holding its first hearing of the 116th Congress today to examine the impacts of the Texas v. United States court case on the #ACA and on Americans with pre-existing conditions.
Every American has a right to avoid unwanted and unsolicited robocalls. Today I introduced the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act with @FrankPallone to strengthen enforcement of robocall regulations and give consumers the right to revoke consent they may have given to receive calls.
Oral arguments kicked off today in @mozilla's suit to overturn @AjitPaiFCC‚Äôs irresponsible repeal of net neutrality. Americans deserve a free and open internet, which is why @SenMarkey and I led an amicus brief w/103 members of Congress supporting net neutrality principles
Social Security is the most successful social insurance program in the history of our country. For 84 years, it has provided an unbroken promise of financial security to millions of Americans, including more than 100,000 beneficiaries in my Congressional District. #Secure2100
Today on FDR‚Äôs birthday I introduced the Social Security 2100 Act with @RepJohnLarson to strengthen benefits, cuts taxes for seniors, and ensure this program remains solvent for the next 75 years. No one should retire into poverty after working their entire life #Secure2100 https://t.co/IEdNJHQpqq
Today I joined @SpeakerPelosi to introduce the Paycheck Fairness Act to end the gender pay gap. 56 years after JFK signed the Equal Pay Act into law, women still earn 80 cents for every dollar earned by men. Women and men doing the same job deserve the same pay. Period. #EqaulPay
