Here‚Äôs what makes this legislation so important to #IL17:

-In 2017, Henderson County, Illinois had a patient to clinician ratio of 6,995 to one.
-It took seven years for a rural hospital to hire one provider.
Rural communities face unique health care challenges we must address. That‚Äôs why I introduced the Rural America Health Corps Act to help solve workforce shortages in rural health care by increasing efforts to recruit &amp; retain health care providers.

‚úîÔ∏è Require campaigns to tell the FBI when foreign govts try to interfere
‚úîÔ∏è Make online ads more transparent
‚úîÔ∏è Close loopholes allowing foreign spending
‚úîÔ∏è Penalize deceptive practices about voting
So foreign adversaries can't influence our elections.
First, @HouseDemocrats passed the #SAFEAct to strengthen our election infrastructure &amp; protect our national security. Now, I will support passing the #SHIELDAct to keep foreign govts from trying to influence our elections. This isn‚Äôt a partisan issue. It's our patriotic duty. ‚§µÔ∏è

I urge the VA to take a hard look at how this inconsistent policy deters veterans, because I‚Äôm sure the veterans of Northwest &amp; Central Illinois aren't alone. I thank the veterans who have raised this issue and will continue to work to alleviate this potential burden.
This unnecessary red tape forces our veterans to jump through additional hoops when they‚Äôre simply seeking the services they need. Our goal should be to make the process as efficient and effective as possible to eliminate additional difficulties like assistance delays.
This additional hurdle has left veterans frustrated and concerned with the VA‚Äôs process and can even lead to veterans giving up on getting help instead of seeking assistance. Our veterans have earned nothing short of the best care and we owe it to them to deliver it.
Veterans seeking assistance have been repeatedly forced to re-sign Privacy Act Release forms that they have previously completed and are under no obligation to resubmit. As a result, veterans are often forced to travel to sign a new form in person or complete them via mail.
I just sent a letter to the @DeptVetAffairs urging them to address inconsistencies in their casework process. While assisting local veterans, my office identified additional hurdles that have left veterans frustrated or concerned with the VA‚Äôs process. ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/n7eP214aSj

Both Democrats and Republicans should want to get to the bottom of whether the President put our national security at risk for his own political gain.

The American people deserve the truth and the Director of National Intelligence must either stand up for our Democracy, or be complicit in hiding that truth.
The President and his administration‚Äôs choice to bury this report is a clear violation of law and order in our nation, which relies on the rule of law to preserve our Democracy.

This legislation has earned the endorsement of all 50 Attorneys General because it protects workers, creates a safer workplace and roots out the bad actors who have routinely swept this problem under the rug.
