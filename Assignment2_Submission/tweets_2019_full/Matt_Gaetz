The Democrats are trying to overturn the will of the American people. 

They ought to be willing to do it in public - but they won’t because if they did, the American people would see for themselves what a sham it is.
During the Russia investigation, the Democrats were willing to put Mueller and others in front of the American people.

It went tragically bad for them – the American people saw the truth and Dems lost support for impeachment. So, their new strategy is to do everything in secret. https://t.co/2S3f5Su4t9
