Refusing to comply with a Congressional inquiry is a blatant attempt to obstruct justice and has proven in the past to be an impeachable offense.
Article One of the U.S. Constitution explicitly states that the House of Representatives has the “sole Power of Impeachment.” https://t.co/cBwt0aDAME

By blocking the testimony of key witnesses like Ambassador Sondland, the White House’s actions are seen as evidence of obstruction.

The only “absolute right” Donald Trump has is to uphold his oath of office, which he has betrayed by inviting foreign powers to influence our free and democratic elections. https://t.co/dZwEZqBom7
This is the exact type of abuse of power and foreign interference that George Washington warned against in his farewell address when he said “foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government.” 

No one is above the law.
The text messages provided to Congress by Kurt Volker make clear that Donald Trump and his Administration made American aid and an official state visit contingent on an investigation into Donald Trump’s political rivals.

To get to the bottom of Giuliani’s full involvement, the House Intelligence Committee has subpoenaed his records of conversations the President had with the Ukrainian President. We cannot ignore such a blatant and illegal abuse of power.
