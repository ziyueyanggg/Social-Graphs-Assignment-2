U.S. abandonment of Kurds in Syria: cynical, shameful and crass
US abandonment of the Kurds is a craven act. They fought and defeated ISIS in Syria as the only effective US ally in that theater. A chapter of shame in US foreign policy.
The Trump Admin is fighting to overturn the ACA’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions in court. Nearly 54 million Americans and 1.3 million Virginians have pre-existing conditions that would make them uninsurable should Trump succeed.

That is why I recently introduced the Protection of Saudi Dissidents Act, which would hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and impose a cost to Saudi Arabia for continuing to engage in such acts of intimidation and violence going forward. https://t.co/HoXCJMmb3T
The best way that we can honor Jamal’s legacy is by pursuing that to which he dedicated his life – the truth – and protect his colleagues from falling victim to the same fate. But the Trump Administration has refused to hold accountable all those responsible for Jamal’s murder.
One year ago today, my constituent and internationally renowned Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi was brutally murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul at the direction of Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman.

To my GOP colleagues who feigned righteous indignation at @SpeakerPelosi for calling out the President’s racist tweets:

Your silence is enabling this.
Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal because he couldn't stand an Obama success. Now, Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon and Trump seems eager to go to war.

But it's not up to him. Only Congress can declare war, and I will fight until the president gets it: #NoWarWithIran. https://t.co/Jc6KI42WTq
