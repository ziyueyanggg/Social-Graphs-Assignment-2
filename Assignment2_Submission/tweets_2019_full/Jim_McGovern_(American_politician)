3/ This decision (made without consulting the Pentagon or State Dept.) will likely cause hundreds of thousands of civilians and internally displaced people living near the border to flee, in addition to disrupting ongoing humanitarian operations. This is a disaster in the making.
2/ What did Trump and Turkish President Erdoƒüan discuss in their phone call before this announcement? Were any promises exchanged for this disastrous and unplanned withdrawal that paved the way for Turkey to move into Syria?
1/ Make no mistake: @realDonaldTrump is trying to please another authoritarian strongman instead of standing w/ our allies.
