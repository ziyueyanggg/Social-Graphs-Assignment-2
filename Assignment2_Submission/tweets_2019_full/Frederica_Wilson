Thank you, @RepMaloney, @RepSpeier, and @RepSchakowsky for keeping alive hope for the 112 still-missing #ChibokGirls. #BringBackOurGirls https://t.co/SqklDY5KXo
High-capacity magazines have no place in our communities. Tragically, they are too often used in mass shootings across our country. I support the #KeepAmericansSafe Act to ban high-capacity magazines. Will @senatemajldr? https://t.co/1iHls0D6Aa
The @TheBlackCaucus ceremony recognizing the 400th anniversary of American slavery was a poignant and restorative reminder that if our ancestors could survive all that they did, we've got this! We shall overcome! #1619Project https://t.co/CDqyIDwGCs
My heart swelled as I listened to @AlfreWoodard's impassioned testimony about all of the greatness African Americans have achieved. She's right. We are "the dream and the hope of the slaves" on whose shoulders we stand. #400YearsLater #1619Project https://t.co/V8olQSy7Bz
Johnnetta Betsch Cole is speaking truth to power about African-Americans’ journey from the slave house to the White House and how despite ongoing inequities, we continue to overcome but still have far to go! #400Years #1619Project https://t.co/XmFr9oXe6X
High-capacity magazines are designed to kill as many as possible in a short amount of time. I’m co-sponsoring @SenatorMenendez @RepTedDeutch @RepDinaTitus &amp; @RepDianaDeGette’s #KeepAmericansSafe Act, which would keep these lethal weapons off the streets &amp; out of our communities. https://t.co/O2cRJGvIOm

This began one of the darkest chapters in American history. https://t.co/NNoyYRGvZK
Today’s the big day! @HouseJudiciary is marking up @SenatorMenendez @RepTedDeutch @RepDinaTitus &amp; @RepDianaDeGette’s #KeepAmericansSafe Act, which would ban high-capacity magazines. https://t.co/4ruUQeqgqX
I hope and pray that the White House is going to show some compassion for Bahamians whose lives literally were blown away by #HurricaneDorian.  
https://t.co/nOPX0AKdTX
I am leading a letter urging our government to help Bahamians devastated by #HurricanDorian and ease some visa restrictions so they can join their U.S. relatives. I also would support a TPS designation for the storm-ravaged nation.

My heart breaks each time I read or see a news report on the devastation #HurricaneDorian has wrought on the #Bahamas, but then it refills with joy when I see how all hands on deck our community is being to help our Bahamian family and friends. Thank you!

I met this family during my Sunday trip to Nassau. They are among the thousands of #HurricaneDorian victims forced to relocate from Abaco Island. https://t.co/QA9cOzoYIB
Grateful to be joined by these fellow #ChampionsForChildren in the fight to #BringBackOurGirls! https://t.co/eC8sFeXVGQ
Thank you, @tylerperry! https://t.co/MN54KMamJV
Landing in Nassau soon, where I will be meeting with the prime minister and #HurricaneDorian victims from the Abaco island, where my family hails from.
After more than 5 years, I remain committed to fighting for the safe return of each of the 112 still-missing #ChibokGirls. #BringBackOurGirls https://t.co/JRgAxKwPGW
The pain Bahamians are experiencing in the wake of #HurricaneDorian is palpable and my heart breaks a little each time I hear or read about their losses.

This is another shameful chapter in American history. We should be doing all we can to support military families, not looting resources intended for them to fund vanity projects!

My heart breaks for the missing 112 #ChibokGirls and all the women and children that have been displaced, kidnapped, or assaulted by Boko Haram. #BringBackOurGirls @JacksonLeeTX18 https://t.co/Eje3gP3aIq
Our Bahamian friends are being inundated by #HurricaneDorian with water from top to bottom. United Way of Miami-Dade and the Miami Herald/el Nuevo Herald have activated Operation Helping Hands to support the relief effort. Every bit of aid helps! https://t.co/3vnZMYSiXn
There but for the grace of God goes Miami. We were spared most of #HurricaneDorian's wrath. Let's do all we can to help the Bahamas recover from this catastrophic event. #Bahamastrong--Miami https://t.co/LumscFJVlD

@fema After this devastating storm, the Coast Guard is conducting search, rescue and recovery missions in the Bahamas. The death toll stands at 5 but is expected to grow as the Coast Guard continues its mission. We will keep you posted. Visit our websites for updates.
The Florida congressional delegation has been briefed daily on the circumstances surrounding #HurricaneDorian. This morning our main focus was on Bahamian search, rescue and recovery efforts. @fema has donated $200,000 to the Bahamas for water, ice, and necessary supplies. https://t.co/KRgA4r9qAq

Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst! District 24 is at your service and we will get through this together. So far, God and the weather have been on our side, but expect lots of rain, wind and power outages! #HurricaneDorian https://t.co/MbiJDnMbnL
Praying for the Bahamas as they  battle this killer storm. I have so many relatives there and represent the largest Bahamian diaspora in the nation located right here in South Florida. District 24, stay tuned for information on how we can help.

While the circumstances are far from ideal, with no school or work today, this is a great time to spend time with your children. Read to them. Share stories about your childhood experiences with hurricanes--and most important, stay safe! #HurricaneDorian
District 24: We're not in the clear yet. Hurricanes are unpredictable, so play it safe. Hunker down with your families. Help your neighbors, especially those who are vulnerable. It seems like the weather is on our side, but expect lots of rain, wind and power outages!

This is horrifying. How many people have to die before GOP lawmakers join Democrats in the fight to combat gun violence? Thoughts and prayers are not enough. #EnoughIsEnough #GunControl https://t.co/VGYwR8spUH
District 24 has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS infections. When decisions are made about how to spend federal dollars combating this public health crisis, our community will have a seat at the table! @CDCDirector https://t.co/8MftnAZG8s
I had a great discussion last week with @CDCDirector about the HIV epidemic. The spread of HIV/AIDS has caused too many preventable deaths and we can all play a part in ensuring our community is healthy and safe. https://t.co/9pQ2wPHW2J
