Since the #TreeOfLife tragedy, at least 12 white supremacists were arrested for alleged plots, threats, or attacks against the Jewish community (@ADL).
One year ago today, as the Pittsburgh #TreeOfLife congregation gathered for Shabbat prayers, a white supremacist entered the synagogue and killed 11 innocent people.

They were known as kind and selfless leaders in their community. And they were killed because of their faith.
Baghdadi led a despicable terrorist group that killed Americans, committed genocide against Yazidis, and killed many others.

Enormous thanks to US commanders, special operators and their partners who planned and executed this important operation.

"Although [9/25] was the 1st time I had seen details of Trump's call w/ Zelenskyy, in which he mentioned VP Biden, I had come to understand well before then that 'investigations' was a term used to mean matters related to 2016 elections &amp; investigations of Burisma &amp; the Bidens."
"I argued to both [Sondland &amp; Volker] that... Ukrainians did not 'owe' Trump anything, and holding up security assistance for domestic political gain was 'crazy,' as I had said in my text to Sondland &amp; Volker..."
"Sondland tried to explain to me that Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check. Volker used the same terms..."
"I expressed my strong reservations in a text message to Sondland, stating that my 'nightmare is [the Ukrainians] give the interview and don't get the security assistance. The Russians love it. (And I quit.).' I was serious."
"I understood a 'stalemate' to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance. Sondland said that this conversation concluded with Zelenskyy agreeing to make a public statement in an interview with CNN."
"[Sondland] said he talked to Trump... he was adamant that Zelenskyy, himself, had to 'clear things up and do it in public.' Trump said that it was not a 'quid pro quo.' Sondland said although this was not a quid pro quo, if Zelenskyy did not, we would be at a 'stalemate.'
"According to Morrison, Trump told Sondland that he was not asking for 'quid pro quo.' But Trump did insist that Zelenskyy go to a microphone &amp; say he is opening investigations of Biden &amp; 2016 election interference, &amp; that Zelenskyy should want to do this himself."
"... the push to make Zelenskyy publicly commit to investigations of Burisma &amp; alleged interference in the 2016 election showed how the official foreign policy of the US was undercut by the irregular efforts led by Mr. Giuliani."
"...both senators stressed that bipartisan support for Ukraine in Washington was Ukraine's most important strategic asset &amp; that Zelenskyy should not jeopardize that bipartisan support by getting drawn into US domestic politics."
"September 5, I hosted Sens. Johnson &amp; Murphy for a visit to Kyiv... we met with Zelenskyy. His first question to the senators was about the withheld security assistance... "
"September 2, Morrison called to inform me... Danyliuk expressed concern about the possible loss of US support for Ukraine... Morrison relayed to me that the inability of any US officials to respond to Ukrainians explicit questions about security assistance was troubling them."
"He said that President Trump wanted President Zelenskyy 'in a public box' by making a public statement about ordering such investigations."
Sondland told me he now recognized he made a mistake by earlier telling the Ukrainian officials that a WH meeting was dependent on a public announcement of investigations--in fact, Sondland said 'everything' was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance."
"During that phone call, Sondland told me that Trump had told him that he wants Zelenskyy to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma &amp; alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election."
"I sent Sondland a text message asking if 'we are now saying that security assistance &amp; a WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?' Sondland responded by asking me to call him... "
"I was alarmed by what Morrison told me... This was the first time I had heard that the security assistance -- not just the WH meeting -- was conditioned on the investigations."
"Mr. Morrison described a conversation Sondland had with Yermak... Sondland told Yermak that the security assistance money would not come until Zelenskyy committed to pursue the Burisma investigation."
"It had still not occurred to me that the hold on security assistance could be related to the "investigations." That, however, would soon change."
"August 29, [Zelenskyy advisor] Mr. Yermak contacted me &amp; was very concerned, asking about the withheld security assistance. The hold that the WH had placed on the assistance had just been made public that day in a Politico story."
"[Mr. Morrison] also told me during this call that the President doesn't want to provide any assistance at all." That was extremely troubling to me... Based on my call with Mr. Morrison, I was preparing [to resign]."
"My concerns deepened the next day... during a phone conversation with (NSC official) Mr. Morrison. I asked him if there had been a change in policy of strong support for Ukraine, to which he responded, "it remains to be seen."
"By mid-August, bc security assistnace had been held for over a month for no reason I could discern, I was beginning to fear that the longstanding US policy of strong support for Ukraine was shifting."
"July 25, Trump &amp; Zelenskyy had the long-awaited phone conversation. Strangely, even though I was Chief of Mission &amp; was scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy &amp; Volker the following day, I received no readout of the call from the WH. The Ukrainian govt issued a short, cryptic summary"
"On July 20, I had a phone conversation with [Ukrainian national security advisor] Danyliuk, during which he conveyed to me that Zelenskyy did not want to bused as a pawn in a US re-election campaign."
"Sondland told me that he recommended to Zelenskyy that he use the phrase, "I will leave no stone unturned" with regard to "investigations" when Zelenskyy spoke with President Trump."
"I asked Volker about [a meeting between Giuliani &amp; Volker] but received no response. I began to sense that the two decision making channels--the regular and irregular--were separate &amp; at odds."
"Ukrainians in the meetings were confused. Bolton, in the regular Ukraine policy... channel, wanted to talk about security, energy &amp; reform; Sondland, a participant in the irregular channel, wanted to to talk about the connection between a WH meeting &amp; Ukrainian investigations."
[Fiona Hill &amp; Alex Vindman] "told me that Sondland had connected "investigations" with an Oval Office meeting for Zelenskyy, which so irritated Amb. Bolton that he abruptly ended the meeting, telling Hill &amp; Vindman they should have nothing to do with domestic politics."
"All the OMB staff person said was the directive had come from POTUS to the CoS to OMB. In an instant, I realized one of the key pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was threatened. The irregular policy channel was running contrary to the goals of longstanding US policy."
July 18: "I heard a staff person from OMB say there was a hold on security assistance... a voice on the call... said that her boss had instructed her not to approve any additional spending of security assistance for Ukraine until further notice. I and others sat in astonishment."
"July 10... Zelenskyy's chief of staff... told me that they had heard from Mr. Giuliani that the phone call between the two presidents was unlikely to  happen and that they were alarmed at disappointed."
"by mid-July it was becoming clear... that the meeting Zelenskyy wanted was conditioned on investigations of Burisma &amp; alleged Ukrainian interference in 2016 US elections. It was also clear that this condition was driven by the irregular policy channel ... guided by Giuliani."
"Ambassador Volker noted that he would relay that President Trump wanted to see rule of law, transparency, but also, specifically, cooperation on investigations to 'get to the bottom of things.'"
"Sondland said he wanted to make sure no one was transcribing/monitoring as they added Zelenskyy to the call... Volker separately told the US participants that he planned to be explicit with Zelenskyy in a 1on1 meeting... about what [he] should do to get the WH meeting."
"I sensed something odd when Ambassador Sondland told me on June 28 that he did not wish to include most of the regular interagency participants in a call planned with President Zelenskyy later that day."
"But during my subsequent communications with Ambassadors Volker &amp; Sondland, they relayed to me that the President "wanted to hear from Zelenskyy" before scheduling the meeting in the Oval Office. It was not clear to me what this meant."
"In late June, one [of] the goals of both channels was to facilitate a visit by President Zelenskyy to the White House for a meeting with President Trump, which President Trump had promised in his congratulatory letter of May 29."
"The delegation returned to Washington enthusiastic about the new Ukrainian president and urged POTUS to meet with him early on to cement the US-Ukraine relationship. But from what I understood, President Trump did not share their enthusiasm for a meeting with Mr. Zelenskyy."
"Although this irregular channel was well-connected in Washington, it operated mostly outside of official State Dept channels. This irregular channel began when Volker, Sondland, Perry &amp; Sen. Ron Johnson briefed POTUS upon return from President Zelenskyy's inauguration."
"however, there was an irregular, informal channel of US policy-making w/ respect to Ukraine, one which included... Volker, Sondland, Rick Perry, and... Giuliani."
"I found a confusing &amp; unusual arrangement for making US policy towards Ukraine. There appeared to be two channels of US policy-making &amp; implementation, one regular &amp; one highly irregular. As the Chief of Mission, I had authority over the regular, formal diplomatic process..."
"I worried about what I had heard concerning the role of Giuliani, who had made several high-profile statements about Ukraine &amp; US policy ... I made clear (to Sec. Pompeo) that if US policy toward Ukraine changed, he would not want me posted there and I could not stay."
"However, in Aug. &amp; Sept. of this year, I became increasingly concerned that our relationship w/Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons."
"I have particular interest in and respect for the importance of our country's relationship w/ Ukraine. Our national security demands that this relationship remain strong."
"I have dedicated my life to serving U.S. interests at home and abroad in both military and civilian roles. My background and experience are nonpartisan and I have been honored to serve under every administration, Republican and Democratic, since 1985."
Yesterday, I attended the deposition of Amb. Bill Taylor, the Chief of Mission of the American Embassy in Ukraine.

Erdogan only cares about Turkish interests here. Why is POTUS deferring? Does he not understand long-term risks to US security?
This move leaves Kurds exposed to Turkish forces and will have massive impact on their ability to hold ISIS detainees. Despite POTUS’ declaration, ISIS is not defeated. This risks serious destabilization in Syria and potentially forces SDF to align with Assad.
