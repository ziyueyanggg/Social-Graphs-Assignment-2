At every step of the way, @realDonaldTrump has acted in his own self-interest. 

This entire policy failure has proven one thing: President Trump is a president not for--but at the expense--of the people.
The president's decision to usher in Turkey‚Äôs military incursion empowered an ethnic cleansing campaign against our Kurdish partners. Period. 

Now he‚Äôs keeping US troops in Syria to control Syrian oil -- which is illegal and unconstitutional. https://t.co/OueKOcd4aG
Today‚Äôs vote to sanction Turkey is one facet of a solution to fix Trump's disastrous policy. 

We can't protect our Kurdish partners in Syria through indefinite troop deployments. We need a multilateral diplomatic campaign to end the violence and create accountability in Syria.
