I will continue encouraging my colleagues to spend time talking to our Veterans and visiting the VA so that policies they push for reflect the needs of our nation‚Äôs heroes.
We have Veterans in #MI01 who‚Äôve waited nearly a decade for their appeals to be heard, and others live hours from the closest VA facility.  Congress‚Äô new reforms are bringing more accountability and access than ever to VA. No one in DC should feel satisfied with the status quo.
This $600 million appropriation from Congress more than doubles federal funding available through USDA‚Äôs longstanding broadband programs.
This will enable the federal government to partner with the private sector and rural communities to build modern broadband infrastructure in areas with insufficient internet service.
ICYMI: The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is now accepting online applications for funding through the new ReConnect Rural Broadband Pilot Program.

Although this legislation includes the word bipartisan in the title, it's just a far-left attack on those who legally own and utilize firearms. HR8 offers no real solutions to the gun violence facing our country.

I just voted in opposition to H.R. 8. This bill is so far out of the mainstream, it would make borrowing a hunting rifle a felony, and subject the lender to the same criminal penalties of those who purchase a firearm for a known dangerous criminal.
