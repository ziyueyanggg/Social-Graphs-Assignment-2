At this time of rising hate and white supremacist violence, we all share a responsibility to call out and condemn bigotry and those who spread it. We must protect the fundamental right of every American of every religion to practice their faith without fear.
Today we remember the horrific shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh when 11 Americans were senselessly killed because of their Jewish faith in the worst antisemitic attack in our nation’s history.
Wishing a very happy #Diwali to all who are celebrating today in our community and around the world. May we all remember that light always triumphs over darkness https://t.co/biAR8IGTRO

Today I will pay my respects to Chairman Elijah Cummings as he lies in state at the U.S. Capitol. We will sorely miss his moral clarity and booming voice of reason, but his presence will long be felt. 

May his memory be a blessing. https://t.co/rhlmKaVc1a

In just four years, the cost of insulin DOUBLED. That's ridiculous – you should be able to afford the medicine you need to stay alive. @WaysMeansCmte Dems are serious about tackling the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs and passing our bill, the #LowerDrugCostsNow Act. https://t.co/lqdpsiftuX
Twisting one of most painful chapters of our history into a political cudgel is disgraceful &amp; dishonors the memories of thousands of Black Americans &amp; others murdered by mob violence.

Chairman Cummings was a beacon of light in Congress, illuminating the path with his character and devotion to his beloved community of Baltimore. His booming voice of reason will be sorely missed, but his presence will be long felt, especially at this time of National need. https://t.co/3yWt2UejRZ
We are only as good as our word, which is why I just voted and the House overwhelmingly passed (354-60) a bipartisan, bicameral resolution opposing the President’s craven decision and calling for Turkey to immediately cease their military attacks in Syria.
The President’s abandonment of our Kurdish allies is more than just tragic for the human suffering it unleashed, it also weakens our national security, undermines our fight against ISIS, and diminishes American credibility. https://t.co/MMM00TuBkC

Don’t forget, the Census counts every resident in the United States – regardless of immigration status. #Census2020
I had a great Census Q&amp;A last night in Prospect Heights. Our nation gets just one chance each decade to count its population, and it’s critical we get it right so that our community gets its fair share of funding for schools, hospitals, roads and more. #Census2020

Yesterday's rampage by a gunman in Germany on Yom Kippur is not just an attack on the Jewish community of Halle, but on all Jews and indeed against people of all faiths.

Each of us, in our own way, must speak out to confront the rise of antisemitism and all forms of hatred. https://t.co/pleTgzI4np
This evening marks the start of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement and holiest day of the Jewish calendar. I wish those observing the holiday a meaningful fast, a day of reflection, and “G’mar Hatima Tova.”

President Trump is again sowing instability aat a time global leadership from the United States is desperately needed. Whether by design or incompetence, Russia and Iran stand to gain the most from this disastrous move.
The President’s impulsive decision to withdraw U.S. forces from positions in Syria and abandon our Kurdish allies will have disastrous repercussions. Making snap decisions without a coherent strategy weakens our foreign policy and threatens national security.

That's why I continue to support the impeachment inquiry. I urge my Republican colleagues to put partisanship aside and speak out against this blatant betrayal of U.S. national security.
It was obviously wrong when President Trump abused the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in our elections in a call with the President of Ukraine. Undeterred, the President did so yet again this morning on live TV. We need to hold the President accountable. https://t.co/MkuvIiTQWH

President Trump’s actions to pressure a foreign government into investigating a political rival are an absolute abuse of the powers of the Presidency.

The President must be held accountable, which is why I support initiating articles of impeachment to do so.

The danger posed by white supremacists and other violent far-right extremists is growing, and we need to update our laws in response. I introduced the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act to improve the coordination of federal law enforcement and direct their attention at the threat
We also need to stand up to the NRA and the gun manufacturers to start changing the culture of guns in this country. And we must defeat the growing ideology of hate that motivates many of these horrific acts of domestic terrorism. 

I am going to be part of the change. Are you?
We need stronger gun safety laws, like the universal background check legislation still waiting for a vote in the Senate. We need more mental health programs and resources. We need to expand economic opportunity in communities suffering from daily violence.
Enough is enough is enough. Before the names of the people murdered in El Paso are even known, yet another mass shooting in Ohio. We must never get numb to these  tragedies. Our thoughts and prayers only matter if backed  up with action to prevent these tragedies.
We cannot continue to respond to this epidemic with shrugs of indifference. I proudly cast my vote for bipartisan universal background check legislation. The Senate must act. This is the least we can do to honor the memories of all those lost daily to gun violence.
I join with all Americans in solidarity and prayers for the victims of yet another mass shooting. Having just returned from two days in El Paso and meeting so many wonderful people, I know the community will be united and find the strength to help each other in this awful time.
I return w/ renewed advocacy for bipartisan immigration reform that both secures our border and reforms our broken and overwhelmed immigration system, and am committed to sending aid to the countries in the Golden Triangle to address the root causes of the migration crisis.
In particular, the policy requiring people legally seeking asylum to remain in Mexico for months while their claim is slowly processed means individuals and families, many with young children, are forced to live in uncertain, overcrowded, and dangerous conditions #DemsattheBorder

Our higher education system remains out of reach for too many and saddles countless Americans who do graduate with insurmountable debt. Education is a cornerstone of the American Dream, and we need to do more to ensure it is achievable for all families.
This is an unacceptable abuse of the legal guardianship system to scam financial aid intended for families who need it most. The Department of Education must exercise proper scrutiny to make sure this vital assistance isn’t going to families trying to game the system. https://t.co/DKFbk5jF1e
Congress must exercise its oversight role ensuring that people seeking asylum are treated humanely and that conditions in border facilities reflect the values of our nation.
This is unacceptable. And it's why this Thursday and Friday I'm travelling to El Paso and Ciudad Juarez to investigate firsthand the effects of the Trump Administration's cruel immigration policies.

Tonight we mark 50 years since the Apollo 11 astronauts landed on the moon and took “one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” This historic accomplishment is a reminder that no goal is too high to achieve when we are united as a nation in common purpose. #Apollo50
Stay safe and cool during this extreme heat wave. Some tips from the @dailyherald https://t.co/Vi7x5CUtDi

Thank you also to @wheelingilgov for providing the space for this event to make our communities voices heard. The full crowd was evidence of the importance of this topic for our residents. https://t.co/8Jw3LugrSM
My sincere thanks to our expert witnesses today: Mike Warner of Lake County Stormwater Management Commission, @HowardELPC  of @ELPCenter, and John Durning of @PizzeriaDeVille  in Libertyville https://t.co/O8slpAOoeH
Wisconsin taxpayers may be paying the price for the Walker administration’s exorbitant economic incentives, but it is Illinois residents &amp; small businesses who will be underwater – literally - due to our neighboring state’s irresponsible decision to ignore environmental reviews
Today we convened a House @HouseSmallBiz  field hearing on the Foxconn development &amp; its effects on local flooding. When environmental reviews are ignored in situations like these, it hurts surrounding residents and strains federal resources like the SBA disaster loan program. https://t.co/SkTnMHNXCv

Proud the @HouseSmallBiz voted to pass out of committee my bipartisan Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act to help more former servicemembers learn to start and grow businesses. #BootstoBusiness https://t.co/1EmiATM0ws
Proud to vote for the #RaisetheWage Act today to increase the federal minimum wage to $15/hour. It’s been 10 years since we last increased the minimum wage. This legislation would give up to 33 MILLION Americans a raise. #FightFor15 https://t.co/rTHCtUiFpr
Tune in to our Telephone Town Hall. Starting now! https://t.co/XCFIqxicyX
John Paul Stevens lived a life dedicated to promoting justice and protecting civil liberties. As the third-longest serving justice in Supreme Court history, he will be remembered both for his thoughtful jurisprudence and his personal kindness. May his memory be a blessing.
It was heartening to see so many members of our community come together on Saturday to declare that families belong together and that the Trump Administration's cruel immigration policies do not represent our nation. https://t.co/G0kpFC4Phr
This is a deplorable, racist attack by the President. Whether born here, arrived as an immigrant or came as a refugee, we are all Americans, and our country is stronger because of our history as a nation of diverse experiences. https://t.co/ydent9efD7
We had a packed house for this morning’s Congress on Your Corner town hall in Lake Bluff. Thanks for coming out and participating! https://t.co/mpXRJIy9cq
I was proud to vote to permanently extend the 9/11 Victims' Compensation Fund. These heroes put themselves in harms way to save others. We owe it to them to have their back now, particularly as many first responders face serious health concerns as a result of their service. https://t.co/sJntP0obD3
More information from on your rights from the Illinois Attorney General's office: https://t.co/6cpUlSCLYS
President Trump is again threatening immigration raids in our communities this weekend. It's important that everyone knows their rights. You do not have to open the door if police officers or immigration agents come to your home and do not have a search warrant.
Proud to be the lead sponsor of this resolution to push back on attempts to delegitimize Israel, support the US-Israel relationship, &amp; restate commitment to a negotiated two-state solution. @HouseForeign mark up is the next step to ultimately passing this important legislation. https://t.co/ZCeI4JTfOG
Great news! The House passed my bill as part of #NDAA to authorize the #BootstoBusiness program to continue offering veteran entrepreneurship training. Our veterans served our country with honor, and they deserve our support as they transition from military to civilian life. https://t.co/gr5bf08cqx
This is a fundamental step to effectively responding to the scale of the challenge, and to speeding the investments in clean energy jobs and the transition to renewable sources of energy necessary to prevent catastrophic impacts across our nation. https://t.co/7hV7LBgyTD
Global climate change is affecting the health of our planet and threatening the future we pass to our children. It requires urgent action now. Today I co-sponsored a new resolution recognizing climate change as a national emergency. #ClimateEmergency
Owen from Deerfield visited me today to share his story and advocate for children living with juvenile diabetes. You can count on me to continue supporting funding for research in the Special Diabetes Program at the National Institutes of Health. @JDRF https://t.co/5D4hy9nffr
UPDATE: I’m glad that President Trump heeded the bipartisan outcry and disinvited Ben Garrison, the creator of a blatantly antisemitic cartoon, from the White House. Someone who spreads such vile hate never should have been extended an invitation. https://t.co/dyv9orscmC
The deal that Secretary Acosta cut with Jeffrey Epstein was a miscarriage of justice. In his role as U.S. Attorney, Acosta failed the victims of Epstein’s abuse and offered the perpetrator outrageously lenient terms. Secretary Acosta has lost the public trust and should step down

Garrison’s vile, antisemitic images deserve contempt and condemnation, and certainly do not warrant a friendly welcome and celebration by the President. https://t.co/l650vAz1So
President Trump must disinvite cartoonist Ben Garrison from the Social Media Summit at the White House. In a time of rising antisemitism, at home and globally, we must all speak out and condemn hateful rhetoric everywhere and every time.
IL lost a staunch advocate for working families in Margaret Blackshere. From her start teaching in a kindergarten classroom to her history-making tenure as the first woman to lead the Illinois AFL-CIO, she never forgot who she was fighting for. https://t.co/3cOjtbbo13
I support the #USWNT fight for equal pay and proudly voted for the #PaycheckFairnessAct earlier this year to help close the gap for all women in the workplace.
"These athletes generate more revenue and garner higher TV ratings but get paid less simply because they are women," said Molly Levinson, spokeswoman for the USWNT players. https://t.co/27KFtg1ZB1

Happy Independence Day! Between the parades and fireworks, I hope we’ll all take a moment to reflect on our nation’s history as a remarkable experiment in democracy that began 243 years ago, and our continued progress to live up to the ideals expressed in our founding. https://t.co/2Mxyodsopm
Great meeting with the community at the Latino Police Academy to give a legislative update on immigration and other important issues. https://t.co/VliQlL1FvM
I'm glad that the Administration will comply with SCOTUS and will not include the citizenship question in the 2020 Census. The Census count must be accurate because the data helps direct more than $675 billion in funding for essential services. Spread the word and be counted!
No one is above the law—not even the President! That’s why I applaud today’s decision by the House Ways and Means Committee to file a lawsuit against the IRS and the Treasury Department to require compliance with Chairman Neal’s request for President Trump’s tax returns.

Our veterans served our country with honor, and they deserve our support as they transition from military to civilian life And many of the leadership, problem solving, and communications skills learned in the armed forces translate well to entrepreneurial and business success.
Congress has a fundamental oversight role over our nation’s federal tax laws, and I hope the NRA will cooperate with this request to determine if the organization is operating according to its intended social welfare purpose. https://t.co/hwOjvmtBC4
This week, I sent a letter to the NRA requesting they make public documents relating to serious allegations of wrongdoing. If the NRA is abusing its tax-exempt status to enrich its leadership, the American taxpayer should not be on the hook to subsidize their scheme. https://t.co/S6A0p1A2Op
To the residents of the Tenth District, I have a simple message: be counted. 

We must ensure the Census accurately measures our neighborhoods and does not shortchange federal resources or representation for our communities
This effectively halts the Trump Administration’s plans to include a citizenship question in a craven and partisan effort to depress participation and skew the results. While this is a positive development, our fight is not over. #Census2020 https://t.co/XOX7miMBL6
It's critical Wehrum’s departure does not delay much-needed public health standards that are under development on ethylene oxide emission. U.S. EPA should release the proposed rule publicly without delay. 

Statement w/ @SenatorDurbin &amp; @SenDuckworth: https://t.co/MsNhYAd8Jj
In Lake County, we remain frustrated that U.S. EPA under his leadership inexplicably refused to conduct ambient air monitoring to measure levels of ethylene oxide, a known carcinogen, in our communities.
