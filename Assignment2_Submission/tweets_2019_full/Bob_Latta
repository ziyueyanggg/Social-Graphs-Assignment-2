The #SAVEMomsAndBabies Act helps ensure this abortion method is recognized for what it is: dangerous.
Without proper medical oversight, it has resulted in hospitalizations, severe complications, and several deaths. Lawmakers and advocates pushing for this pill to be available on demand and over the counter are neglecting the safety and health of women across this country.
While the national abortion rate decline is welcome sign, the dramatic rise in use of the abortion pill should worry pro-life and pro-abortion activists alike. We know from patient testimonies and FDA studies that there is nothing simple or easy about the chemical abortion pill.
Today I introduced the #SAVEMomsAndBabies Act, which would prevent labeling changes for already approved abortion drugs; prevent providers from dispensing these drugs remotely, by mail, or via tele-medicine; and prevent the FDA from approving new chemical abortion drugs.

Earlier this month, I was in Perrysburg for the groundbreaking ceremony for Ohio Cat’s 40-acre facility. The site will house its Ohio Cat, The Cat Rental Store and Northern Ohio Peterbilt operations. It’ll be an impressive campus when it’s built! https://t.co/3UM4dz4WQi

Under this agreement, phone companies will offer several robocall blocking technologies to their customers – a proposal of mine in our bipartisan Stopping Bad Robocalls Act, which passed the House last month.
An issue as complicated as combating illegal robocalls requires a team effort. Great to see states like Ohio partnering with phone companies, the @FCC, and Congress to offer relief to families. 
https://t.co/x6VkAkytgO
As our phone tech improves and innovates, scammers improve and innovate right along with it. Today’s tech also means it’s cheaper/easier than ever to flood our phones w/ calls. That’s why House passed Stopping Bad Robocalls Act to help combat these calls.

Government should have to balance its budget just like every family and business across this great country. I will continue to fight for solutions that grow our economy and improve life for Americans.

I am an original cosponsor of H.J.Res. 22, a balanced budget amendment.
I voted against the budget deal that raises the debt ceiling and increases government spending by $322 billion. Washington doesn’t have a revenue problem; it has a spending problem. Without spending reductions, I couldn’t support a debt ceiling increase.

Israel is not what’s wrong with the Middle East -- it’s what’s right. Israel is a democracy, and they are our closest ally in the region. We will continue to support them against anti-Israel and anti-Semitic attacks.
The House passed a resolution opposing efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel, including the Global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement which targets Israel. This vote by the House shows the strong support that exists for the Israeli people and their government.

#RaiseTheWage to $15 means employers have less incentive to hire younger/less experienced workers and workers with disabilities. As author of column asks, if basic service jobs are no more, where do these individuals find an entry point to employment? 
https://t.co/VP0562n5b9
#raisethewage vote is tale of two visions. One side you have a record of pro-growth/family/worker policies that create jobs, lower taxes and help Americans pursue their dreams. Other side you have top-down government-knows-best approach that jeopardizes growth of the past 3 yrs.
Ignoring warning signs and recklessly raising the minimum wage to $15 hurts small businesses and their workers in Ohio and across America, and risks millions of people -- especially those on the margins -- losing their jobs.
Our booming economy is felt in wages, tax returns, and lives of underserved communities who are able to get back to work. Since Jan. 2017, 5.6 million new jobs created. For first time in a decade, lowest-income Americans are getting the greatest benefits from recent jumps in pay.
The House repealed Obamacare's #CadillacTax, a 40% excise tax on high quality employer-sponsored health insurance plans that would have raised taxes for more than 181 million people. Glad to see Dems agree w/ us that families don’t need higher taxes.
