America should leave Afghanistan and return (if necessary) on our terms. We do not negotiate with terrorists.
@juliesue69 While Orwell and Huxley seem almost prescient these days, I like Ike. Eisenhower‚Äôs farewell address is fact, not fiction...
@juliesue69 America‚Äôs mfg companies aren‚Äôt monolithic, but yes some companies (all sorts, not just mfg) definitely love endless wars. On the other extreme, Obama‚Äôs plans to close the Lima tank plant were short-sighted &amp; more expensive. A strong military is essential, endless wars are not.
I expect that Afghans will be glad to keep America there as long as their leaders are secure, their poppies are growing, and cash keeps flowing. America pulls security while China mines the resources... ‚ÄúGreat nations don‚Äôt fight endless wars.‚Äù $46-billion per year?! 18 years?! https://t.co/i2rSLi2vw8

Woke capitalism by companies like Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods, Gillette (P&amp;G), Walmart, etc... will be great for small business.
Updating America‚Äôs financial kitbag with tools like the Foreign Investment Risk Reduction Modernization Act (FIRRMA) is a vital component of national security. This is one of the relevant consequences. #DeedsNotWords  https://t.co/V7TRawB6Ub
@Micah_Fields_ It is certainly a factor. Democrats dominate the coasts and major cities where cost of living is highest. The urban : rural divide is growing. @DNC wants to respond by eliminating rural districts and the electoral college. Both tactics would under represent rural constituencies.

@ramie13 Nope. The business wouldn‚Äôt go to jail. The business owner(s) would. Plenty of better ways to accomplish the mission...
@ramie13 Business owners who don‚Äôt file a form with an agency few even know exists (FINCEN) face up to three years in jail and fines of up $10,000.  Every business must file, but businesses with &gt;20 employees get a waiver from future filings. If you like that, ok. I am opposed.
@ramie13 With due respect, if you have read the bill and think it doesn‚Äôt apply to small businesses, then you don‚Äôt understand the bill.
@ramie13 Rachel - I'm very familiar with the bill, having not only read it but also worked to amend and obviously stop it. It would have the biggest impact on businesses with fewer than 20 employees and less than $5-mil in revenue, thus NFIB... You can read it too: https://t.co/XodT21oL1j

Border security is national security. With a secure border, &amp; an end to domestic sanctuaries for illegal immigration, America needs to reform legal immigration. Whenever a legal market has supply artificially lower than demand, black markets form. Cartels are enemies &amp; exploit...
Failure to address the root cause will not correct the problem. Specifically, in this instance, lower rates will not provide the certainty needed to restore capital spending that was cancelled, deferred, or delayed due to ongoing uncertainty. https://t.co/7Iz90n9Qt8
Rationally, greater uncertainty and greater risk of default demand higher rates, not lower. The warning signs are due to uncertainty, not cost of capital.
ü•∫ü§ï America‚Äôs central bank is destroying the value of our money less aggressively than others, and the plea is for the Fed to follow towards negative interest rates?? Who would loan money to anyone for 2, 10, or 30 years at 0% interest?!? Let alone pay for the privilege? https://t.co/YQwpcL24t3
After failing to drag America and @realDonaldTrump into more wars in more places, the swamp is desperate to keep America in Afghanistan - spending nearly $50-billion per year. "Great nations do not fight endless wars."
Problem solving that fails to address root cause fails to solve problems. Whatever logical fallacy is employed instead will miss the mark. #DeedsNotWords https://t.co/nLqrxdBfm7
Nevertheless, media activists will sensationalize nearly anything to stop the tremendous momentum @realDonaldTrump and @GOP pro-growth regulatory &amp; tax reform have had on America‚Äôs economy.
Warning signs are not a manufactured media crisis. Businesses &amp; farmers have expressed the same concerns about uncertainty since last year. They have reacted rationally by delaying investments. Consequently, we are seeing results of slower capital spending &amp; ongoing uncertainty.
Wars are generally won by multiplying allies rather than by multiplying enemies. Reversing that paradigm is inherently high risk. Absent an imminent deal w/ China negotiators should attempt to unite our allies to deal w/ China‚Äôs horrible trade abuses. https://t.co/u2RsVCd6Ni
