Chairman Nadler wants to hold the U.S. Attorney General in contempt for refusing to break the law! The AG has fully complied w/the Special Counsel regs &amp; applicable laws. He has gone above &amp; beyond to provide the public with a look into the #MuellerReport. This is all a charade.
I will not support any budget deal that increases our country‚Äôs federal spending. Our nation‚Äôs $22 trillion debt is unconscionable and it is a burden to our children &amp; future generations. I join my colleagues in urging @SpeakerPelosi to #HoldToTheCaps. https://t.co/jso6o0sHkJ

I‚Äôm proud to cosponsor the Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act. Our veterans and their families have already sacrificed so much. They should not have to worry about losing their benefits due to an arbitrary law that requires them to forfeit their payments they so deserve.
