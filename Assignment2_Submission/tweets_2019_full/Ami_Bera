@StateDept We must send a strong signal to our #diplomats that they are valued, and that starts with retaining and promoting our best and brightest public servants. The #STANDAct does just that.
@StateDept Career #diplomats dedicate their lives to serving the American people and government both home and abroad.

They serve on the front lines of American #diplomacy, helping mitigate and prevent some of our country‚Äôs most pressing #foreignpolicy issues.
@StateDept At the same time, I have been deeply troubled by reports of the Trump Administration sidelining @StateDept policy experts on critical national security issues and retaliating against career employees.

@StateDept During a time of increasing complex global challenges and #NationalSecurity threats facing the US, we must have our most qualified and experienced public servants representing the United States around the world. #STANDACT
@StateDept Under this Administration, a record # of Ambassador positions have been filled by political appointees. While it‚Äôs true that some have a wealth of professional experience that contributes to our nation, many individuals have little to no prior diplomatic experience. #STANDAct
