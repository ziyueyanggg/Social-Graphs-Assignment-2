States that refused to expand Medicaid under the ACA have seen the rate of uninsured children 3x as large as states that have expanded. Kids should not have to suffer because TN has not expanded Medicaid.

President Trump‚Äôs plan to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods is foolish. Tennessee has been hit especially hard by Trump‚Äôs last round of tariffs and our state‚Äôs economy will suffer even more when these are implemented. No one wins in a trade war. https://t.co/08IrxEJsz4 https://t.co/vbeb6h8anI

Some of my House colleagues and I are at the U.S./Mexico border this week to see first-hand the challenges facing our immigration system. I believe there‚Äôs a way to secure our borders and treat migrants humanely. https://t.co/2o7LlcxapV
Proud of Davidson County‚Äôs leadership in getting voting machines that will help keep our elections safe and secure. I hope other Tennessee counties will follow suit. https://t.co/RiPu8X7w00
Partisan politics and gerrymandering have taken over our elections and helped create the gridlock we‚Äôre seeing in Congress. This bill will allow the voices of more Americans to be heard. https://t.co/CHNIr1ARVq

Everyone has a right to due process under the law. Expedited removal encourages racial profiling and denies immigrants their right to go before a judge. It does not make our country safer. It makes our communities more fearful. https://t.co/5HzYaicnML
@RepWalberg The public needs access to this information. I‚Äôve always said sunshine is the best disinfectant. To read the full release, visit https://t.co/YLXoepbppA.
To provide Americans with more information on how their tax dollars are being spent and help eliminate duplicative and wasteful government programs, @RepWalberg and I are reintroducing the bipartisan Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act.
@NIDAnews TN is also seeing a rise in overdoses. According to the @CDCgov, overdoses fell nationwide in 2018, but TN is seeing more overdose deaths than ever before. https://t.co/10eC06ykky https://t.co/UXl8spjZ0N
And although in more recent years the number of opioid prescriptions has decreased nationally, according to the @NIDAnews, TN still has the 3rd highest opioid prescribing rate in the country - 1.5x greater than the national average.
In Dickson County 58.3 pills were being distributed person per year.
In Davidson County 49.1 pills were being distributed per person per year.
In Cheatham County 43.2 pills were being distributed per person per year.
From 2006-2012 Tennessee was 4th in the US in the number of opioid pills distributed per person, per year.
This week a DEA database that tracks the path of every single pain pill sold in the United was made public and the data is chilling. https://t.co/7bVc8rtpTw https://t.co/ad7DQ9lGoi

To see my full statement on the Raise the Wage Act of 2019, visit my website: https://t.co/eudbpq94sR
By raising the minimum wage, nearly 140,000 hard-working Middle Tennesseans will see a pay increase. It is long overdue.
It is virtually impossible to support yourself and your family when you earn $7.25/hour. I‚Äôve met with and heard the stories of Metro Nashville school employees, fast-food workers, and others who work hard every day to support their children.
The chants seen and heard on TV at the Trump rally last night were one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen. We should be fighting hate and prejudice, not embracing it. Any incitement of this behavior is unbecoming of a U.S. president and hurts America.
The House had no choice but to vote to hold Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross in contempt for ignoring the law and refusing to provide the requested documents. Congress‚Äô job is oversight and the American people deserve to know the truth.
After reports of security concerns with a certain app, I want to remind everyone that this is a risk for many different apps. Be careful sharing your personal information! https://t.co/nj36QjofS0
These officials are charged with overseeing children‚Äôs health insurance programs in our state and can‚Äôt explain how at least 220,000 children were dropped from the rolls. This is unacceptable. Tennessee children deserve better.
‚ÄúLast year TennCare disenrolled more children than any other state Medicaid system ‚Äì not just because a growing economy lifted poor families out of poverty ‚Äì but because late, incomplete and unreturned paperwork made it difficult to tell who was eligible and who wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù https://t.co/vVM81sjT4e
A normal President goes to church on Sunday and prays for the safety and well-being of his countrymen and women. He most certainly does not attack and threaten capable, duly-elected women who are as American as he is.
I think most Americans think that we can have secure borders and humane borders. To see my question to the panel at the @OversightDems hearing on the Trump administration‚Äôs child separation policy today, read the transcript below or watch the video here: https://t.co/gltRmio443 https://t.co/upWKsrh3lc
Dr. Christina Bethell @CBWeThrive : ‚ÄúI was one of the first babies on Medicaid in California, and I was hospitalized eleven times and saw a lot of ER doctors. And I would be dead without Medicaid.‚Äù
Dr. Denese Shervington explained that she works with people on death row, ‚Äúwhen all the damage had already been done.‚Äù She emphasized that it was important to think about prevention, so that inmates did not end up with someone like herself working to get them mercy.
I asked the panel: "The elephant in the room is this: Can we really help our kids in states that have refused to even extend Medicaid?‚Äù Here are some of the responses I received: https://t.co/ob3A7TRzeP
In yesterday‚Äôs @oversightdems hearing on identifying, treating and preventing childhood trauma, we heard from among others, Tennessee‚Äôs own Jim Henry, the model example of a dedicated public servant.
Title X helps millions of women ‚Äì the majority of whom are low income and women of color ‚Äì get preventative care like cancer screenings, gynecological visits, HIV testing, and other health care services. The gag rule is harmful to women‚Äôs health.
I am disappointed that a panel of conservative judges ruled that President Trump‚Äôs Title X gag rule can continue.
Nat‚Äôl defense bill is up. @repjimcooper:  "This bill denies President Trump‚Äôs request for a new low-yield and nuclear weapon for use on our nuclear submarines ‚Äì a request that would undermine our security.‚Äù

My bill with @RepCohen, @RepTimBurchett, @RepJohnRose, @RepDavidKustoff, the SONG Act, will give the FAA the power it needs to protect all of our events. Congress needs to quickly pass it.
I think Nashvillians agree if drones or small planes aren‚Äôt allowed to fly over Nissan Stadium during a Titans game, then they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to during a Taylor Swift or Thomas Rhett concert either.
Did you know the FAA restricts flights over stadiums during sporting events but not concerts?
We cannot sit back and allow politicians to pick who they want to represent.
The redistricting process should be transparent and nonpartisan, which is why I‚Äôve introduced the John Tanner Fairness and Independence in Redistricting Act and the Redistricting Transparency Act in Congress again this year.
Just like racial gerrymandering, partisan gerrymandering should be illegal. https://t.co/Cn6QPDL5KT
