This is an issue that will impact every American and every industry in our economy. If we continue our failure to address this crisis, the economic consequences will be devastating across the nation. That‚Äôs why we need #ClimateActionNow
Just last month, I held a hearing on the macroeconomic effects of #ClimateChange, and the warnings we heard from experts were similarly alarming. Labor force displacement, rising sea levels, &amp; decreased crop yields are just a few byproducts of a rapidly warming planet.
‚ÄúA set of assumptions &amp; practices in economics has led economists both to underestimate the economic impact of many climate risks &amp; to miss some of them entirely.‚Äù
 
#ClimateChange already costs taxpayers billions, &amp; we may be underestimating future costs.

Suicide is a senseless and preventable outcome for so many Americans, but we have to have the tools to identify when one of our loved ones is showing signs of depression, anxiety, and/or suicidal thoughts. Let's pass this bill and get our kids the support they need!
That's why I introduced HR 3778, the Cady Housh and Gemesha Thomas Student Suicide Prevention Act, which would give funding to schools so that school personnel and students can receive proper suicide awareness and prevention training.
Among America's youth, the issue is even more severe. Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for Americans aged 12-18, and 4 out of 5 teens who attempt suicide have given clear warning signs.
This week marks National Suicide Prevention Week, and it's important that we bring awareness to this awful epidemic. In the US, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death, with over 47,000 Americans dying by suicide in 2017.

That's 129 lives lost per day.
