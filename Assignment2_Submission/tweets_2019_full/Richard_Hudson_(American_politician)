Chancellor Dubois and Lisa have been tireless advocates for @unccharlotte and I want to express my sincere appreciation for all they‚Äôve done. Renee and I wish them and their entire family all the best as they look to this new chapter of their lives.
As both an alumnus &amp; the first Member of Congress to graduate from @unccharlotte, it has truly been a privilege working with Chancellor Dubois, &amp; I look forward to continuing this partnership through his retirement next year. I‚Äôm also proud to call him a dear friend.
Chancellor Dubois has spent nearly 20 years serving our great university &amp; has done so with steadfast leadership, unbeatable commitment, &amp; ‚Äì most notable of all ‚Äì love for #NinerNation. I know this because I‚Äôve seen the respect &amp; admiration faculty, staff &amp; students have for him. https://t.co/zwKZ1K9KXv
