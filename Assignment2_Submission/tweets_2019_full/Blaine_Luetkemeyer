President @realDonaldTrump is committed to keeping American citizens safe and I wholeheartedly support his efforts to secure our nation.
America is facing a crisis at the border and instead of working to protect those who elected us, my colleagues have decided to waste time on a purely political resolution.
Knowing full well this resolution has no chance of being signed into law, today my Democratic colleagues advanced another futile attempt to obstruct the President‚Äôs statutory authority and overturn his national emergency declaration.
Tune in! https://t.co/srvL5bXHbV
