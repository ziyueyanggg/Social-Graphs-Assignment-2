@realDonaldTrump Your polls must have been done on Oppidite Day.
The higher the stakes, the uglier it gets. If you want a better federal government, then limit its power, as the Constitution prescribes.
“We are leaving soldiers to secure the oil. And we may have to fight for the oil. It’s okay.”

No, Mr. President, it’s not okay. It’s unauthorized and unconstitutional. Despite his talk of ending wars, Pres. Trump always finds an excuse to keep them going. Now, it’s Syrian oil.

Senator Graham continues to mislead. The Constitution divides impeachment and trial between the House and Senate. The House impeachment is an indictment. The process he’s demanding happens in the Senate trial. No defendant participates in an indictment in the way he’s suggesting. https://t.co/9107Mp3Fqm
@realDonaldTrump Totally makes sense.
President Trump continues to send more troops to the Middle East while publicly claiming he’s bringing them home. There are more U.S. forces there today than when he took office.
Bill Taylor’s testimony is devastating evidence that President Trump engaged in both a corrupt act and a quid pro quo.
Impeachment in the House is an indictment, not a trial. The Senate conducts the trial. President Trump constantly demands special treatment that is not afforded other Americans. And to liken the constitutional impeachment process to a “lynching” is reprehensible and shameful. https://t.co/P2nmaXiSiZ

What distinguishes America’s political system is our adherence to process; the Constitution and Rule of Law are more important than achieving a specific outcome in a specific instance. Under tyranny, only the ends matter, and when your group is in power, you do whatever you want.
When I heard Hillary’s remarks, I knew exactly what the right would say: The left smears anyone they don’t like. To my Dem friends: Recognize that this plays right into Trump’s hands; that it diminishes the legitimate inquiry into Russia; that it bolsters Trump’s “hoax” nonsense.
Hillary does—and did—drive many people into the arms of Donald Trump. Her attack on Tulsi does likewise. In my district, Trump did worse than any Republican in modern times and still beat Clinton by a fair margin. Many Ds in the Midwest rejected her. I didn’t vote for either one.
The thing we know for sure is that Hillary Clinton is a Donald Trump asset.

Today’s joint resolution presented precisely the false choice above. That’s why I voted present. Americans don’t want perpetual war, and Congress should vote on war if they believe in it. Nonetheless, we need much better leadership in the White House. President Trump is reckless.
The only alternatives in Syria are not perpetual U.S. presence or the current disaster. Our troops should have come home long ago. The disaster resulted from President Trump’s egotistical, transactional approach. He put the U.S. in a position of weakness by ignoring consequences.

President Trump long ago could (and should) have withdrawn from Syria and worked to keep out Turkey. Instead, he pulled back a few troops (no withdrawal) and green lighted Turkey’s attack. His sudden concern about endless wars is just cover for his having facilitated a disaster.
@chrismattmann I’m opposed to boots on the ground in Syria. It’s Donald Trump, president since January 2017, who has kept our troops in Syria, Iraq, and other places without any proper authorization. I’ve been fighting on this issue since long before Trump became president.

1. We shouldn’t have any U.S. forces in Syria without congressional approval.

2. We shouldn’t tell Turkey it’s okay to invade Syria.

President Trump is keeping troops in Syria; just moving some. And despite Trump’s Twitter warnings, Turkey would not invade without his go-ahead.
Endless war continues.

President Trump is moving a small number of troops out of Turkey’s way. He is not ending our military involvement in Syria. https://t.co/kr2wXrsbmI
President Trump is not ending any war. He insists on keeping American troops in Syria in violation of our Constitution. He’s simply moving troops out of a specific area and green lighting Turkey’s attack on the Kurds and others who have helped combat ISIS. It’s just more war.
U.S. forces should not even be in Syria without congressional approval. Regardless, Turkey would not take this action without the express consent of the White House. It’s disingenuous for President Trump to suggest it’s all about “ISIS fighters” when the target is Kurdish forces.

@MexiCaliBlue19 Maybe that’s because you joined Twitter in January 2017.
Trump says all this while supporting violations of our rights: FISA 702, the Patriot Act, asset forfeiture, eminent domain, secret watch lists. And *God-given* rights are not based on citizenship.

Every day, President Trump and his defenders tell us not to believe our own eyes and ears. We read or hear the president’s words, and we’re told to reject the natural and ordinary meaning. We see evidence of wrongdoing, and we’re told it proves virtue.
President Trump’s defenders mischaracterize the favor. Trump says, “I would like you to do us a favor though.” He mentions CrowdStrike.

They want you to believe he stops there.

But he continues: “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son….”

The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do…
Again, it’s not just about a call, but even the call is a devastating indictment of the president.

Trump: We do a lot for Ukraine.

Zelenskyy: We are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.

Trump: I would like you to do us a favor though.

@ShaggyKC No, but Trump supports unconditional spying if he’s not the target. He signed FISA 702 into law and endorsed the Patriot Act/Freedom Act.
Trump’s presidency is the natural outcome of the not-my-side-ism that pervades today’s politics. When you’re convinced the other side is uniquely responsible for the country’s ills, you’re liable to vote for anyone, no matter how unsavory, who will keep the others out of power.
@Buddy3880309 @Dan4Liberty @keithhinkle I didn’t vote for any of those, BOT nice try. 😉
@keithhinkle Trump has not kept any such promises. He’s kept us in unauthorized wars. He’s expanded unconstitutional spying. He’s signed record amounts of wasteful spending. He’s promoted corporate welfare. He’s supported new federal crimes. And he’s authorized more abusive asset forfeiture.
The two parties sometimes violate different rights, but often they work together against the people: unauthorized wars, unconstitutional spying, wasteful spending, corporate welfare, overcriminalization, asset forfeiture, etc. That they are not equally bad does not make one good.

There’s this thing called a search engine. Could someone please help him out? https://t.co/f9r4NwhYtT
President Trump is now demanding a permanent reauthorization of the NSA’s unconstitutional, warrantless program to collect Americans’ phone records.

We must demand that he and Congress respect the Fourth Amendment!

@Just___Jess99 Spent the day in GR with my family! Hope you had a good time in DC. Thanks for stopping by!
This was a fantastic interview about love and loss. Thank you, @andersoncooper and @StephenAtHome. https://t.co/svNBmv9Q4R
@the_grid_runner My tweet was sarcasm, but buying Greenland is actually one of his saner proposals.
@peamom You made up my position on all these things, including the president.
@peamom You just made that up, too. I didn’t even vote for Donald Trump. Are you new here?
@peamom No, but thanks for the false accusation in the form of a question.
We must not reauthorize the Patriot Act/Freedom Act.
Okay, this I can get behind. https://t.co/eedqCyOp92
Last year, Pres. Trump signed FISA 702. This year, he wants to reauthorize the Patriot Act and Freedom Act. These unconstitutional domestic spying programs must end. Congress should pass my bill, #HR1942, to end mass collection of Americans’ phone records. https://t.co/lmF5Z9Amce https://t.co/WLUb8pKoGE
Israel should stand up to President Trump and allow our colleagues to visit. Nobody has to agree with their opinions, but it will inevitably harm U.S.-Israel relations if members of Congress are banned from the country. We must find ways to come together; there’s enough division.
@RepHuizenga May God comfort you and your family. May her memory be eternal.
Thank you for illustrating why Americans shouldn’t trust that your red flag law won’t be used arbitrarily to violate our rights. https://t.co/3ffE0gNwz5
Nobody has more power to influence the tone of public discourse than the president. Instead of blaming everyone and everything else for inciting resentment and hate, President Trump should check his own words and actions. We all must do better, especially the official at the top.
@morganisawizard @teamamash Yes. A wizard experienced in uniting the free peoples of Middle-earth in battle against Sauron and his armies is preferred.

There was a time when the GOP establishment hated Donald Trump. They then realized they could use a man like this—unprincipled, transactional, shameless—to push their agenda. McConnell and McCarthy are giddy about Trump. Conservatives in Congress are the ones privately horrified.
@ScottPettyMN Nice!
@MattJReynolds 💯
Same message we hear from the GOP establishment every time: Spend now. Cut later.

Donald Trump is the most politician-y person we’ve ever seen in government. It’s like the establishment created him in a laboratory to help promote their BS. https://t.co/Q6rzZtINfC
An important note for people talking about the federal budget:

Spending bills are valued over a one-year period. Tax bills are valued over a 10-year period.

In other words, a $1.3T spending bill is 10x larger than a $1.3T tax bill. The spending bill has 10x the deficit impact.
As long as the president faces no political consequences for growing government, Republicans in Congress will stick with him, and fiscal conservatism is dead. If you want to revive it, then you must hold President Trump accountable just as you would anyone else in DC.
Ostensibly conservative organizations keep sending emails (rightly) slamming Republicans in Congress for the disastrous budget deal, while (wrongly) giving a pass to President Trump, who negotiated, pushed, and will sign the bill into law.
@annakatclarke We’re out until September!
@annakatclarke Thanks! You always seem to stop by when I’m not around!
@TimAlberta Praying for you and your family. Your dad was able to see you accomplish so much. May his memory be eternal.

Instead of all this contempt and scorn, how about being the president for all America and all Americans? https://t.co/NQn2AXQxiH
Michigan abolished capital punishment in 1846. The U.S. government has had a moratorium on this horrendous practice since 2003. Now, President Trump and AG Barr want to resume executions. This week, I joined @RepPressley to introduce a bill to prohibit the federal death penalty. https://t.co/lW5bZKS332
He’s thanking Pelosi, McCarthy, and other “leaders” for increasing spending and debt at a near-record pace. This president promised to drain the swamp; instead, he’s become the PR person for the Washington establishment. https://t.co/hDwB42I1Tf

Today, I forced a vote to rename the budget bill that suspends the debt limit, “A Bill to Kick the Can Down the Road, and for Other Purposes.”

47 voted to name this bill honestly.
