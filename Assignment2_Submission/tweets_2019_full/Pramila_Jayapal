From the epidemic of violence faced by trans women of color... to attacks on synagogues, churches, mosques, temples, and gurdwaras… to the homophobia, racism and xenophobia we saw unleashed in Orlando, Charlottesville, and El Paso...
10 yrs ago, Pres. Obama signed a hate crimes law bearing the names of Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., two Americans lost to hate violence. It was a historic step forward -- but we must acknowledge that hate violence persists today, and in some places is even on the rise.

That’s what we need to do in America, and that’s what #MedicareForAll does.

Have a streamlined &amp; guaranteed govt insurance plan.
One that doesn’t leave you when you're sick/ unemployed/change jobs/unable to afford huge increases in premiums, co-pays &amp; deductibles—&amp; provides COMPREHENSIVE CARE.
Half-way measures like a Medicare Buy-in or a public option don’t work b/c they don’t address the COST of the overall for-profit system designed to put profits over patients. 25-30% of the $3.6 trillion we spend every year on healthcare in America is due to administrative waste.
▶️ 70 MIL people uninsured/underinsured

▶️ 500,000+ people declaring bankruptcy each year due to medical costs

Boeing’s profit motivation trumped safety—with deadly consequences. Congress must uncover who knew what and when. 
We must hold senior execs accountable for their delayed disclosure &amp; other corporate wrongdoing to restore the American people’s trust.

Resignation is not a ‘get out of jail free’ card from accountability. Rick Perry must comply with Congress’ impeachment inquiry.

Only in the Trump administration would the Secretary of Energy deny the science of climate change, embrace the coal industry &amp; waste our precious energy resources... but only resign after getting embroiled in an impeachment investigation.

My republican colleagues must now answer a simple question: when will you stand up to this President’s lawlessness?
The facts aren’t up for debate. Trump, Mulvaney &amp; others have admitted what happened! The president held taxpayer dollars hostage for his own personal &amp; private gain.
Dumbfounding. The Acting White House Chief of Staff wants the American people to “get over” President Trump’s reckless violation of his oath of office. It’s government BY &amp; OF the people—not FOR the President’s personal profit.

For-profit institutions are notorious for preying on low-income individuals and students of color who seek a better future. An associate’s degree from a for-profit college currently costs four times as much as it would from a public university. (3/)
When the Art Institute of Seattle abruptly closed earlier this year, students – many of whom are my constituents – were left with burdensome debt, incomplete degrees and few options for recourse. They deserve better.

This is textbook Trump. 
 
Manufacture a crisis, scramble to pick up the pieces, then act as if he alone is responsible for solving it.
 
This is not effective foreign policy. It is immoral, inconsistent, and a stain on our global standing.

By striking down barriers to affordable public and private health coverage, #HEAL4Immigrants would improve immigrants' ability to get health care info and services, while serving as a strong counter to Trump's callousness towards immigrant rights.

The hole in our hearts is deep. During early days of family separations, Elijah pulled me close &amp; thanked me w/tears in his eyes. He said even if I felt I was screaming into the wind, I should stay strong, keep fighting for justice. He was such a supportive &amp; clear moral leader.
We have lost a good and gracious man, someone who brought tremendous integrity, moral clarity and enormous heart to our work and the Halls of Congress.

My prayers are with Chairman @RepCummings family, constituents and staff.

We must take action to protect children and others from dangerous weapons. This is only the first step of many in ending the epidemic of gun violence (end)

Happy #PronounsDay from the proud parent of a non-binary kid.

Pronouns aren’t just about accuracy – they’re about acceptance. Not sure what pronouns to use? Ask politely! And when someone tells you their pronouns, use them.

Nearly a third of immigrants of reproductive age are uninsured. For low-income immigrant women, that figure rises to 48% - Almost half are uninsured! We must remove barriers to access health care.
Undocumented folks, including DACA recipients, have always been excluded from health care programs such as the ACA. This is unjust and discriminatory.
@RepDebHaaland Immigrants have to wait five years after getting a green card to be eligible for Medicaid and CHIP. This forces these immigrants to rely on an unsteady patchwork of care from their employer or community health center. #HEAL4Immigrants
Today, @RepDebHaaland and I reintroduced the #HEAL4Immigrants Act, which would remove the 5 year bar on immigrants accessing programs like Medicaid.

On Indigenous People's Day, we honor those who have stewarded our lands and waters for millennia, and we recommit to honoring tribal sovereignty. We also must do more for Native communities -- including addressing the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women.
"Hispanic people overall accounted for $1.5 trillion, or 10.4% of total US buying power in 2018, according to @TerryCollege. That's a 212% jump from 2000."
