None of the safeguards of our judicial system apply to the arbitration process. No real judge, no jury, &amp; no right to appeal. It‚Äôs a closed process, allowing businesses to avoid accountability for disputes involving sexual harassment, discrimination, &amp; unsafe work conditions.
84% of voters from both sides of the aisle oppose forced arbitration. Americans understand just how unfair it is ‚Äì yet many consumers don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs often a pre-condition for cell phone contracts, credit card applications, and even employment.
Millions of consumers and workers are impacted by forced arbitration, which bars people from suing companies in federal court ‚Äì instead forcing victims to pursue this private dispute resolution method that almost always favors the companies. https://t.co/vBE0aD1HID
