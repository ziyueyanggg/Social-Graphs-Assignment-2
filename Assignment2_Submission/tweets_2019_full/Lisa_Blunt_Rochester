Some of my many stories and memories of Sonia come from her time on the board of the Metropolitan Wilmington Urban League. She carried with her a quiet but clear strength which she used every day in further pursuit of justice and equality.
It is difficult to put into words the profound impact that Sonia Sloan made on every person who was fortunate enough to spend any amount of time with her. Almost all who did have their very own Sonny story.
I was proud to vote to advance H.R. 3 – the Lower Drug Costs Now Act out of @EnergyCommerce. Right now, Americans pay two, three, sometimes 60 times more than other countries for the same prescription drugs.

The American people deserve to see the full picture of this President’s conduct – an impeachment inquiry allows us to do just that.
It appears that the President of the United States and his allies attempted to pressure a foreign government into investigating a domestic political adversary. Congress needs to see the full whistleblower complaint that the Administration is illegally withholding immediately.
While I was of the opinion in July that we had sufficient facts and evidence to move forward with an impeachment inquiry, these latest developments underscore the need and urgency of that inquiry.

Four years ago, parishioners of the Emanuel A.M.E. Church welcomed a stranger into their sanctuary to join them in prayer. What followed was a hateful act of racism that took nine lives. Today, and every day, we must remain vigilant and commit ourselves to ending that racism.
It should be swiftly and strongly condemned by all members of Congress, regardless of party.
I carry with me, every day, a scarf emblazoned with the voting card of my great great-grandfather. It is a constant reminder of how sacred but fragile our right to vote is. @realDonaldTrump's encouragement of foreign interference is beneath the office of the Presidency.
Last night, we saw the President move beyond just degrading those norms and into the realm of encouraging foreign adversaries to interfere in our elections. Make no mistake – it is illegal for a foreign power to interfere in American elections.
We are a nation of norms and of laws. Beyond the damaging policies and regulations that this Administration continues to pursue, perhaps the most dangerous aspect of this presidency has been the degradation of our most sacred norms. https://t.co/RlpiWYtSLX

Delaware women earn 89 cents on the dollar because of the wage gap, which is even worse for women of color, with African American women earning 70 cents and Hispanic women earning 59 cents on the dollar. We must act now to ensure equal pay for equal work.
That’s why I was proud to be a cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which passed the House earlier this year. It is my hope that the Senate will soon take up the bill to strengthen the original #EqualPayAct.
#OTD in 1963, President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law. While the #EqualPayAct has brought up closer to pay equity, we still have a long way to go until we can say definitively that women earn equal pay for equal work. https://t.co/BRzh1NMXNT
If you have a few minutes, I encourage you to take the time to read this remarkable piece by @DOPOJeff. Jeff has done a wonderful job of telling Delaware's story of D-Day &amp; preserving the memory and legacy of our heroes. #DDay75years https://t.co/yysyPAI3YA
Thinking of heroes like Pvt. William Morris of Rockland, DE on #DDay75thAnniversary. I hope we can all take a moment of thought and reflection for all those who made the ultimate sacrifice, storming the beaches of Normandy, to defeat the Nazi regime.
I'm proud to join my colleagues today in passing bipartisan legislation to fight ocean acidification, protect our coastal species, &amp; combat climate change #ProtectOurOceans 🌊
In #netDE, coastal activities add:
⛱ $6.9 billion to our economic production 
⛱ $711 million to our tax base 
⛱ 60k jobs to our economy
It's #CaptiolHillOceanWeek, which means it's an opportunity for me to share with my colleagues just how important ocean conservancy, coastal protection, and programs like @DESeaGrant are to Delaware. https://t.co/LJei5mPBHI
I am proud to have voted to uphold that commitment and to pass the American Dream and Promise Act. It is my hope that the Senate quickly takes up this legislation and sends it to the President’s desk for signature. #ProtectTheDream
I cosponsored the American Dream and Promise Act not only because it represents the kind of common-sense immigration reform that Americans demand, but because it represents America keeping a promise it has made to these young people.
Dreamers are Americans in every way except on paper. I’ve met with Dreamers up and down Delaware and have been moved by their stories, their dreams, and their dedication to the only home many have ever known.
#EidMubarak to all those who celebrate! Wishing you a joyful end to Ramadan. https://t.co/LHvjwTu3LQ
Today I joined my fellow Delawareans for the Delaware Commission of Veterans Affairs Memorial Day Ceremony. May we be uplifted by their example. May we be recommitted to the ideals and principles for which they fought. https://t.co/TzW0Hm1BYW
More than 1.1 million women in Missouri may lose access to safe, legal abortion care, marking the first time an entire state will go without access since 1974. This is  unacceptable and alarming, and we must stand firm against attempts to unravel #RoeVWade https://t.co/QSD2ELorw7
On #MemorialDay, we remember those who gave their lives to protect our safety, freedom, and values. While we can never fully repay those who made the ultimate sacrifice defending our country, let us honor them by keeping our promises to today’s veterans and their families. https://t.co/qqROfi5T8c

Access to safe drinking water is a necessity for Delaware and our entire country, but unfortunately, it is not a given. The #LIFTAmerica Act invests $21 billion to provide state and local govts funding to protect people’s drinking water. https://t.co/zKhicoNuxj

65 yrs ago, the #SCOTUS ruled that separate but equal facilities were inherently unequal. #BrownvBoard set the stage for desegregation across all sectors of our society—but there is still much to be done.
