THIS is why @SpeakerPelosi launched impeachment? REALLY?

-No quid pro quo
-No discussion of foreign aid

To top it off, President Trump was asking Ukraine to look into serious and troubling issues regarding foreign interference in American elections.
This was never about Russian collusion or Ukrainian prosecutions.

It is all about undoing the 2016 election and the will of the American people. (3/3)
.@SpeakerPelosi’s decision to pursue impeachment now—on the basis of unsubstantiated, indirect, and anonymous allegations—only shows that the Speaker has finally succumbed to unrelenting pressure from the Socialist wing of the Democrat Party. (2/3)
Democrats have been trying to impeach the President since the beginning of this Congress.

-Michael Cohen’s testimony was a bust
-John Dean’s testimony was a waste of time
-The Mueller report did not live up to the hype

Last night @RepJerryNadler announced that Democrats are already doing an impeachment inquiry.

The same day he announced it, we confirmed what we already knew: the “Russian collusion” narrative was built on coordination between top FBI/DOJ officials and the Clinton campaign.
There were three major clusters of meetings between Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steele:

-Right after the 2016 election
-Right after the inauguration
-Right after Comey was fired

They were out to get the President.
Bruce Ohr 302s show that FBI officials were out to get the President.

The FBI formally documents witness interviews in 302s. There’s two reasons to do this:
-To build a case against the guy you’re talking to
-Or to use it to go after someone else

We know they weren’t after Ohr!
FBI terminated their formal relationship with Steele because he was leaking. 

But DOJ official Bruce Ohr continued to meet with Steele and reported to the FBI about those meetings.

Why did top FBI officials try to hide their relationship with Steele?
