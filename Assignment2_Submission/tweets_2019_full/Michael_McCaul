Additionally, the whistleblower has volunteered to testify before Congress. It is irresponsible that House Democrats have moved forward before these actions have occurred. (4/4)
The Acting Director of National Intelligence will be briefing members of Congress on Thursday on the whistleblower allegations and the full transcript of President Trump‚Äôs call with his Ukrainian counterpart will be released tomorrow. (3/4)
It‚Äôs a disappointing rush to judgment because we don‚Äôt even have the basic facts yet. (2/4)
The most serious matter the House can consider is Articles of Impeachment against the President. Unfortunately, House Democrats are moving forward to impeach President Trump based on only press reports and hearsay. (1/4)
