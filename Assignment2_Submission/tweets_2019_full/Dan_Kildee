@TheBlackCaucus Throughout his life, John Conyers helped to advance many important causes, including expanding voting rights and equal rights for all Americans. Jennifer and I extend our condolences to John's family during this difficult time.
John Conyers was a fighter for civil rights who served the people of Detroit in Congress for over 50 years. As a founding member of @TheBlackCaucus, John Conyers rose to become the longest-serving African American in Congress and Dean of the House.
@CIA The death of al-Baghdadi is a major accomplishment, but it does not mean that ISIS is defeated. We must remain vigilant. America must have a comprehensive strategy, working with our allies, to root out ISIS terrorists that still pose a threat to our national security.
To those who supported the operation that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, including American special forces, our Kurdish allies, the @CIA and our intelligence officers, thank you for bringing this barbaric terrorist to justice.
Let's be clear—what my GOP colleagues did this week to disrupt order wasn't some heroic March on Washington. It was a publicity stunt.

@EPAAWheeler @realDonaldTrump @EPA Sadly, @EPAAWheeler's visit to Michigan today is trying to mask the Trump Administration’s terrible environmental record. It takes a lot of nerve to fly into Michigan and celebrate #GreatLakes programs that the Trump Administration previously tried to eliminate.
@EPAAWheeler @realDonaldTrump Just recently, Trump’s @EPA announced a weak revision of the Lead and Copper Rule, which would allow lead pipes to remain in our drinking water systems, even after dangerous levels of lead have been found.
@EPAAWheeler @realDonaldTrump The Trump Administration repealed the Clean Water Rule, which is a handout to corporate polluters that increases pollution in the #GreatLakes.
@EPAAWheeler .@RealDonaldTrump's own budget nearly eliminated the #GreatLakes Restoration Initiative, slashing funding by 90 percent to protect Michigan’s water from invasive species.
@EPAAWheeler Let's remember the Trump Administration and @EPAAWheeler's terrible record when it comes to protecting clean water and our environment:
.@EPAAWheeler is in Michigan today celebrating #GreatLakes protection programs. But actions speak louder than words—the President and the Trump Administration have repeatedly tried to eliminate these same initiatives in past years.

Asking foreign governments to help you win re-election is an abuse of power, @RealDonaldTrump. It's also a betrayal of your oath of office and puts America's national security at risk.

With such irrational behavior, @realDonaldTrump is further weakening America’s credibility around the globe. The President is also making a mockery of career foreign service diplomats who work tirelessly to promote American interests abroad.
Denmark is an important NATO ally and incredible partner to the United States that helps to promote peace and stability around the world.
The President’s mere suggestion that Denmark—a sovereign nation—would sell part of its country to the U.S. is absurd. But canceling a planned visit to Denmark over his own foolishness isn’t just petty—it greatly jeopardizes America’s long-standing relationships with key allies.
