This is another choice by the Administration to attack our most vulnerable immigrant neighbors.  I join my House colleagues in urging the Administration to immediately reverse this inhumane and unnecessary policy and to approve the pending medical deferment requests.
This policy change is unfair to families who followed longstanding USCIS procedures for requesting deferred action, only to discover in a denial letter that those policies have changed.  It is extremely troubling that USCIS applied this policy retroactively.
Last month, applicants for medical deferred action began receiving letters from USCIS rejecting their request for deportation deferral and notified them that they have 33 days to depart the country or risk deportation.
@USCIS Medical deferred action provides temporary relief from deportation for immigrants, and their families, with life-threatening health conditions that cannot be properly treated if they were deported.
.@USCIS‚Äôs elimination of non-military #DeferredAction at field offices places vulnerable individuals at risk of deportation and death. The agency must fully restore deferred action adjudications.
