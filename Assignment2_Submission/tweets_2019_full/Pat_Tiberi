As your next Trustee, Larry will be dedicated to preserving our quality of life and ensuring that our first responders have the resources they need. On November 5th, vote Larry King for Genoa Township Trustee.
Larry has lived in Genoa for over 25 years, and he has devoted an incredible amount of time and effort for our safety forces and the building of a new police station.
It was an honor to represent Genoa Township in Congress for over 17 years. My wife and I chose to live in Genoa 15 years ago because it is a safe place to raise a family. That’s why I’m supporting Larry King for Township Trustee.
