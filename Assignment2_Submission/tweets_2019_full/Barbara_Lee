Deeply saddened by the passing of Diahann Carroll. She broke TV barriers, bringing the African American experience to the small screen. She was a talented actress and performer and she will be missed. My heart is with her family and loved ones at this difficult time.
From increasing solar power to lowering energy consumption, we have easy, commonsense solutions at our fingertips to combat #ClimateChange. We need to get serious and #ActOnClimate before it's too late. https://t.co/3vkFJ4Vcsz

These laws are designed to block access to the constitutionally-protected right to abortion. We refuse to go back to the days of back-alley abortions. #StopTheBans #MyRightMyDecision https://t.co/puiKatiyiE
It's clear that Trump and his cronies made foreign assistance contingent on an investigation into his political rivals to help his own reelection. This should trouble all Americans. #Impeach https://t.co/k2MhUP4Q6s
The Trump Administration's public charge rule is a xenophobic attempt to keep out immigrants of color. We must say #NoToPublicCharge.   https://t.co/wxkcR8Ve5l
We have a responsibility to protect the most vulnerable people on earth, like Noor and her sons. Trump's refugee policy is an erosion of what America stands for and slams the door in the face of those escaping horrors at home. https://t.co/R7nsZTTdXr
October is #LGBT History Month! From my friend @RepDavids to blues legend Gladys Bentley, the #LGBT community has made our country better. Let's lift up and celebrate our beautiful #LGBT community and continue to fight for #Equality for all.
Make no mistake: abortion is still legal in all 50 states — but this fight is far from over. We must keep up the pressure to #StopTheBans and protect the constitutional right to an abortion. https://t.co/OHE6qSi3iC
Happy wedding anniversary to @BarackObama and @MichelleObama as you celebrate 27 years of marriage today. Your love continues to touch us all!

Rosie Jimenez died 42 years ago because the #HydeAmendment denied her access to a safe abortion. No one else should die because they can't afford care – it's past time we honor Rosie’s memory by repealing Hyde once and for all! #BeBoldEndHyde  https://t.co/RdrqleD6vq
Happy Birthday to my friend and our awesome chair of @TheBlackCaucus @RepKarenBass. Wishing you another amazing year! https://t.co/vH9Nq16MKr
Trump's proposal for DNA testing of immigrants fleeing violence and hardship is absolutely disgusting. I'll say it one more time: seeking asylum is not a crime. #DontLookAway https://t.co/JmR39Ac321
Just because he does it in the open does not make his abuse of power OK. A democracy that fails its duty to address a lawless leader is no longer a democracy. #ImpeachmentNow

It's been one year since Jamal Khashoggi was brutally murdered by the Saudis. There has been zero accountability and Trump still supports that same regime's cruel war against the people of #Yemen. #JusticeForJamal #YemenCantWait https://t.co/4bbzZyV9zy
Wishing my friend @SenSanders a full and speedy recovery.
Trump is trying to systematically dismantle all of our environmental protections so his billionaire buddies can pollute as they please. Now is the time for more research and fact-finding about our climate, not less! #ClimateActionNow https://t.co/6j62ITTuIa
Trump has betrayed his oath of office and co-opted the powers of the presidency for personal gain – and Secretary Pompeo tried to help him cover it up. We need to #Impeach now. https://t.co/XtgvWyJMZ6

#OTD in 1977, the Food Stamp Act was signed into law. This is personal to me – as a single mother, I relied on food stamps as a bridge over troubled waters. I’ll keep fighting against Trump’s dangerous proposals to take away food from everyday families. #HandsOffSNAP
