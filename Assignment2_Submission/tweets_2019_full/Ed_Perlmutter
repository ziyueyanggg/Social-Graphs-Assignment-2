President Trump has tried to obstruct the impeachment investigation by refusing to comply with doc requests, subpoenas &amp; demanding administration officials not appear before Congress.

Today he helped coordinate a physical obstruction to the proceedings. This is unprecedented.
From the start of the impeachment investigation, Republicans &amp; Dems on the relevant cmtes have been included &amp; allowed to question witnesses. 

Attacking the process is just easier than answering whether it's ok for #Trump to pressure a foreign leader to interfere in our election
Lifting sanctions on Turkey is the latest in a series of impulsive &amp; dangerous decisions related to #Syria. The President is once again acting as Putin‚Äôs puppet, making foreign policy decisions that benefit #Russia while harming our allies &amp; further destabilizing the Middle East.
We now know President Trump‚Äòs campaign to pressure Ukraine into undermining our elections went on for months. They knew it was wrong, many in his own Administration raised alarms, but he believed he was above the law.
