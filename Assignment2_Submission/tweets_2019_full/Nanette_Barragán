- POTUS asks Ukraine to ‚Äúdo us a favor and investigate (dig up dirt on) Joe Biden.‚Äù

When the President asked a foreign government to investigate his political opponent, he not only betrayed his oath of office, he  seriously compromised our national security. This act alone leaves Congress no choice but to exercise it‚Äôs oversight duty and impeach this President.
