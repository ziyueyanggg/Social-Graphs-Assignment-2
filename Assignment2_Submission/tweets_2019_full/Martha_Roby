The military installations in AL-02 &amp; across our state perform vital work for the security of this nation, &amp; I'll always advocate for them. It is an honor to have a platform to fight for those who serve us all. More in my weekly column via @MGMAdvertiser: https://t.co/T9nW5Z8aPJ
I was joined by @RepDougCollins, Ranking Member of @JudiciaryGOP, in introducing H.R. 3533, the Combat Violent Crime Act, to update current US code &amp; allow for more effective prosecution of individuals who commit violent crimes. More: https://t.co/g67xKaddRu
On Mon., SCOTUS struck down a portion of US criminal code related to crimes committed w/ firearms, ruling the statute unconstitutionally vague. In his opinion, Justice Gorsuch stated Congress could update/clarify the language. Today we took a step towards accomplishing that goal.
This is a fantastic group of students, &amp; we've been fortunate to have them on Team Roby this month. More information about my summer internship program is available here: https://t.co/rrjgLi9Xkm
The goal of their proposal is to increase the number of trafficking reports while reducing the number of victims of these heinous crimes. I appreciate their eagerness to tackle such a critical issue impacting communities across the country.
This wk, my DC office's 2nd session of summer interns presented their legislative policy proposal, &amp; I'm so proud of their hard work. They chose to focus on measures to combat human sex trafficking, including implementing preemptive education for school-aged youth &amp; educators. https://t.co/orvuldeJaF
