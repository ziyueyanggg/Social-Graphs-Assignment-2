Just look at this new report that Trump wants to shoot migrants and refugees in the legs, electrocute them, create a border moat, and more. Walls? Moats? Snakes? Alligators? Spikes? Did he forget the burning tar? This is sick behavior from anyone, much less an American president. https://t.co/XpeBGKFfFW
Trump continues to fashion himself a besieged medieval autocrat instead of a president for all the people, and he has a medieval immigration policy to match -- cruel, bigoted, and dehumanizing. https://t.co/0eb117jFA5

.@SecretaryCarson‚Äôs efforts to eliminate @HUDgov grants and programs that we know work ‚Äì and his targeting of our immigrant communities ‚Äì will make housing insecurity worse in my district, and across LA, California, and the country. I hope his visit to #CA40 changes his mind.
Sec. Carson wants to deny housing aid to US citizens &amp; lawful residents if they have even a single family member in their household who does not qualify for housing assistance due to their immigration status. This cruelty will throw hardworking SELA families out of their homes.
Sec. Carson wants to end programs proven to fight homelessness, including HOME Investment Partnerships, Community Development Block Grants, Choice Neighborhoods &amp; the National Housing Trust Fund. Those cuts total nearly $5 billion/year in safety net aid to low-income communities.
Just this year, @SecretaryCarson called for eliminating 140,000 Section 8 housing vouchers that low-income households rely on to avoid homelessness. LA needs all the vouchers it gets, and slashing them will leave our communities with fewer resources to house families.
HUD @SecretaryCarson is in #CA40 today. While he's in the district, I hope he will see that his calls for a 18% cut in housing affordability &amp; homeless programs at HUD are cruel &amp; counterproductive, &amp; that his budget proposals will inflict deep pain on our vulnerable communities.

As DHS Approps Chair, I'm fighting to fix our broken immigration system and ensure every migrant is treated humanely. I've also led the House's passage of my #DreamAndPromiseAct to protect our nation's #Dreamers; now the Senate needs to join us &amp; pass my bill to #ProtectTheDream!
As we fight to build an America that works for ALL our residents, we cannot -- and I will not -- leave #Latinos behind.  I want every American, regardless of their race or ethnicity, to have access to a good job, a fair wage, a first-class education, and affordable health care.
As the first #MexicanAmerican congresswoman, I wish you a happy #HispanicHeritageMonth! Our #Latino community is diverse, dynamic, talented, and hardworking. They are central to America's history and essential to America's greatness.
