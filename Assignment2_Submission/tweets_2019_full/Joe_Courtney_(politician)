@uscensusbureau @AccessHealthCT Improving our #healthcare system doesn't have to be bitterly partisan. But spiking the rates of uninsured Americans by making it more difficult to even enroll for coverage through the #ACA isn't the way to find common ground.
@uscensusbureau @AccessHealthCT The #ACA helped a record number of Americans finally access quality #healthcare &amp; Congress has opportunities to work together to make improvements. For example, my bill to repeal the ACA's #CadillacTax passed the House with 419 votes - a massive #bipartsian majority.
For the first time in nearly a decade, @uscensusbureau reports that the number of Americans w/o #healthcare has risen. Thanks to @AccessHealthCT the numbers in #CT improved slightly, but nationwide more &amp; more Americans are going without #healthinsurance. https://t.co/PqMrCFO1Iv

There's no doubt that #China is a bad actor on the global economic stage - the question is whether this Admin.'s go-it-alone #TradeWar is the best solution. If you ask many of our eastern #Connecticutbusiness owners and their employees who are taking the hit, it's not.
The effects are being felt across many different industries. I've met recently w/the owners of RDI in#Branford &amp; CNC Software in #Tolland, both who told me that #tariffs are hurting their businesses. The@hartfordcourant covered more on the story here: https://t.co/r92ZHSR2Y5

After the House passed the 2020 #NDAA earlier this summer, which included my amendment to protect Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits from impending DOD rule changes, the DOD took note, announcing a delay in the rule-chance while Congress works to codify my amendment once &amp; for all. https://t.co/PkEYBp2B8I
There was #bipartisan opposition to this course of action when the POTUS first announced this plan, &amp; it’s unwise for SecDef Esper to gouge his own Department while this move is still being challenged in court. @TheDay covered more on the story, read here: https://t.co/bqrF8lqOvG
