@USDA I look forward to working with @USDA to ensure this interim final rule works for Maine #hemp growers and provides them with eligibility for the full range of USDA programs. #mepolitics

It‚Äôs outrageous that President Trump has disbanded the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs domestic terror intelligence unit as acts of hate continue to plague our communities.
I was waiting for all of the facts to unfold before commenting on what happened in #ElPaso, Texas yesterday, but it‚Äôs clear that this killer was radicalized to commit an act of domestic terrorism.
My heart is broken for the victims of the gun violence in #ElPaso and #Dayton. These murderers have robbed dozens of their lives‚Äîand all Americans of the safety we should feel while going about our daily routines.
I‚Äôm devastated and angry about the horrific gun slaughter of at least 29 people in #ElPaso and #Dayton within the past 24 hrs. The House has passed common sense legislation to address gun violence but the Senate refuses to act. This is absolutely unacceptable! #mepolitics

@HouseJudiciary Every POTUS swears an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. It is indefensible that President Trump did not do everything in his power to help the investigation into Russia's indisputable attack our democracy.
@HouseJudiciary Today's hearings were an important step to hold President Trump accountable for failing to mitigate foreign election interference.
Mr. Mueller told the @HouseJudiciary Committee, ‚Äòobstruction of justice strikes at the core of the government's effort to find the truth and to hold wrongdoers accountable.‚Äô He is absolutely right. Congress‚Äôs constitutional role is to be a check on the Executive branch.
As a decorated former Marine and former director of the FBI under Republican and Democratic presidents, Mr. #Mueller today emphasized the gravity of these obstruction findings and reiterated that his report does not exonerate President Trump of impeachable acts. https://t.co/uh0ehsKw0l
Today the Special Counsel testified that President Trump made multiple attempts to obstruct his investigation into foreign election interference, including lying to investigators.
It‚Äôs crazy this even needs to be said, but any foreign attack on our nation should be handled seriously by our Commander in Chief. Yet, Mueller made clear that Pres. Trump has not responded appropriately to this foreign attack‚Äîinstead he has obstructed the DoJ's investigation.
All of our intelligence agencies‚Äîfrom the CIA and FBI to the NSA‚Äîhave reached the same conclusion as Special Counsel Mueller: Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election in a sweeping and systematic fashion. https://t.co/6FqnOaYc2P
