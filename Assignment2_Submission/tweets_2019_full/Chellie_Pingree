📢 Hearing on farmers &amp; @ClimateCrisis HAPPENING NOW https://t.co/XehG5moXyu
Great to have another #Maine organic farmer in DC today! Ben Whalen of Bumbleroot Farm just testified before @HouseAgDems about how organic farms sequester carbon (see: fight #climatechange)&amp; how @USDA programs—from research to conservation funding—support young farmers like him. https://t.co/QNyYAZeCRX
The 116th Congress established the nation's first-ever Select Committee on the @ClimateCrisis to prioritize the greatest challenge to our future.
 
Today @ 2:30 I'll join the Committee for its 1st hearing on how farmers can fight #climatechange.

@USDA I look forward to working with @USDA to ensure this interim final rule works for Maine #hemp growers and provides them with eligibility for the full range of USDA programs. #mepolitics
For months, I’ve urged the @USDA to establish federal rules clarifying legal pathways for #hemp growers. When the 2018 Farm Bill legalized hemp, the industry should have flourished, but their success was hindered by a lack of federal regulations. #mepolitics https://t.co/cnxGBMbwco

President Trump sees refugees as a problem, not an opportunity. Maine needs people, and refugee admissions offer a way to help our state grow and thrive. His decision to slash admissions to 18,000 is immoral, short-sighted, and wrong.
Past presidents embraced America’s #refugee program because they understood our standing as a beacon of hope &amp; safety for millions.

When President Trump and his advisors meet on Tuesday to determine next year’s refugee admission levels, I hope they’ll demonstrate some compassion for those fleeing unimaginable persecution, violence, and danger to seek safety in the United States.
Since taking office in 2016, Trump has effectively zeroed out refugee admissions from many nations around the world torn apart by famine, political unrest, and war, including Afghanistan &amp; Iraq. In Maine, we've seen a 98% drop in Afghan refugees &amp; 97% drop in Iraqi refugees.

The Trump admin’s attacks on women's health have caused @PPMEAF and @FPAMaine to forgo funding that supports basic preventive care for 22k Mainers. @AppropsDems  FY2020 budget would block Trump’s #gagrule, but the Senate must act to ensure Mainers don't lose access. #mepolitics https://t.co/LVlw69lO1u
I’ve been sounding the alarm about the Trump admin’s decision to relocate @USDA researchers. I filed H.R. 1221 &amp; secured language in the @AppropsDems budget to keep these experts put.

5 months ago, the House passed #HR8 &amp; #HR1112—bipartisan legislation to prevent gun violence. Mitch McConnell has since stalled a vote.

ICYMI: Wolfe’s Neck received $5M from @FoundationFAR to fight #climatechange &amp; help farmers reduce carbon emissions. 40% of Earth’s surface is used for agriculture—it’s our job to create sustainable systems that keep farmers in business &amp; soil healthy.

https://t.co/6aeWIRSzYD
It's true that our mental health system needs more focus &amp; funding. Increased access to affordable care and other supports for people with mental illness needs to be a priority. But @ChrisMurphyCT is right—it's not a substitute for passing meaningful gun safety legislation. https://t.co/V3xcdbMOdv
Trump fails to understand the causes of or the solutions to the gun violence epidemic in this country.

Words without action is not how we save lives. Where was his support for universal background checks when the House passed #HR8?
Once again, the Trump admin is silencing our scientists. @USDA researchers study key topics like the devastating effects of climate change on agriculture—topics the Administration has repeatedly undermined at the expense of real data for farmers. This is a huge loss for USDA. https://t.co/BJSeU9xEng
Last week numerous people were killed while attending a garlic festival in #Gilroy, CA by a man holding similar extreme and hateful beliefs as the El Paso murderer. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I’ve worked to restore funds to counter domestic extremism.
It’s outrageous that President Trump has disbanded the Department of Homeland Security’s domestic terror intelligence unit as acts of hate continue to plague our communities.
I was waiting for all of the facts to unfold before commenting on what happened in #ElPaso, Texas yesterday, but it’s clear that this killer was radicalized to commit an act of domestic terrorism.
My heart is broken for the victims of the gun violence in #ElPaso and #Dayton. These murderers have robbed dozens of their lives—and all Americans of the safety we should feel while going about our daily routines.
I’m devastated and angry about the horrific gun slaughter of at least 29 people in #ElPaso and #Dayton within the past 24 hrs. The House has passed common sense legislation to address gun violence but the Senate refuses to act. This is absolutely unacceptable! #mepolitics
As the oldest + most rural state, #Maine will hugely benefit from greater telehealth options. I’ve worked on @AppropsDems committee to fund broadband expansion at $680M for FY2020—connectivity is a key to unlocking the full potential of telehealth.

@HouseJudiciary It’s for these reasons that I have called for an official #impeachment inquiry. https://t.co/k0aY8Gw4Yl
@HouseJudiciary Every POTUS swears an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. It is indefensible that President Trump did not do everything in his power to help the investigation into Russia's indisputable attack our democracy.
@HouseJudiciary Today's hearings were an important step to hold President Trump accountable for failing to mitigate foreign election interference.
Mr. Mueller told the @HouseJudiciary Committee, ‘obstruction of justice strikes at the core of the government's effort to find the truth and to hold wrongdoers accountable.’ He is absolutely right. Congress’s constitutional role is to be a check on the Executive branch.
As a decorated former Marine and former director of the FBI under Republican and Democratic presidents, Mr. #Mueller today emphasized the gravity of these obstruction findings and reiterated that his report does not exonerate President Trump of impeachable acts. https://t.co/uh0ehsKw0l
Today the Special Counsel testified that President Trump made multiple attempts to obstruct his investigation into foreign election interference, including lying to investigators.
It’s crazy this even needs to be said, but any foreign attack on our nation should be handled seriously by our Commander in Chief. Yet, Mueller made clear that Pres. Trump has not responded appropriately to this foreign attack—instead he has obstructed the DoJ's investigation.
All of our intelligence agencies—from the CIA and FBI to the NSA—have reached the same conclusion as Special Counsel Mueller: Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election in a sweeping and systematic fashion. https://t.co/6FqnOaYc2P

With the oldest workforce in the nation and record low unemployment, #Maine cannot afford to turn away people who want to make a fresh start here. In the short-term, asylum seekers need support while they put down roots and wait for their work permitting to be approved.
When hundreds of people fleeing conflict arrived in @CityPortland, the community responded by opening their doors and donating thousands of dollars to support their needs.

I’m proud to serve in the most diverse Congress in our history. President Trump’s attempts to dehumanize duly elected lawmakers simply because they do not look like him is a lesson in how not to lead a democracy.
President Trump seems intent to divide us, but we cannot let him. It’s up to each of us to uphold America's ideals if he won’t. That’s why I will be voting for a resolution to condemn his racist attacks on four sitting members of Congress.
As I go back to Washington today, I'm taking Maine's values of inclusiveness w/ me. 

In the face of Pres. Trump’s racist statements + his admin’s assaults on immigrant communities, Mainers have responded by welcoming asylum seekers—even donating as much as $800k to support them.
I’m proud to serve with @RepAOC, @RashidaTlaib, @Ilhan, and @AyannaPressley. They are courageous Americans who are working on behalf of their districts to solve our nation’s problems. More than we can say for our current president whose daily mission seems to be to divide us.
