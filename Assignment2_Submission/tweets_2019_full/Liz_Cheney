I look forward to continuing to work in Congress to end scam robocalls once and for all, and I applaud the FCC for their actions, including Chairman Pai’s proposal today, to do the same.
Today, I cosponsored a bill to prevent scam robocalls.  The TRACED Act would put a stop to the endless stream of robocalls people across Wyoming and the nation are experiencing everyday, and protect them from being scammed.

America’s nuclear triad — including the mission carried out by the men and women at FE Warren's @90thMissileWing — is at the heart of our nation’s security.
