Proud to meet and stand with @AIPAC delegation in Washington, DC. Discussed need to support Israel as our strongest ally and only democracy in Middle East. We emphasized the need to oppose BDS movement and anti-Semitism on college campuses. https://t.co/Mostfdi7Qt
ISIS Leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi is dead. Killed by U.S. Special Forces. Outstanding victory against terrorism. The fight goes on. God Bless America.
Today is one year anniversary of horrific massacre at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Vital to denounce all anti-Semitism. Must never forget. Rosemary and I will visit the “Museum of Jewish Heritage - A Living Memorial to the Holocaust” in lower Manhattan.
Vital that all honest Americans support Durham investigation of FBI, CIA abuses against Trump 2016 campaign. Long overdue. Justice must be done and abuses exposed.
Very meaningful meeting in Washington today with @LauraONSBOD, President of @OncologyNursing, discussing anti-vaping legislation and the need to educate youth about dangers of vaping. I am co-chairman of anti-vaping Caucus. https://t.co/ad1BVSGoTX

Great event in Washington, DC today as @RepTomSuozzi and I were honored by the Lt. Det. Joseph Petrosino Association. Det. Petrosino created the NYPD Bomb Squad in the early 1900’s. Was 1st NYPD Officer killed in line of duty overseas. https://t.co/wLIHXVUOnE
Elijah Cummings. Good man. True gentleman. R.I.P.
.@KingJames disgraces himself by dismissing Hong Kong activists and ignoring China’s oppression. Time for @NBA to show some guts. Proud that House passed legislation last night affirming support for Hong Kong.
Congrats to @chazzpalminteri and @NYGovCuomo for successful effort to fund statue for Mother Cabrini!
Happy Columbus Day to all my Italian-American friends and constituents!

Strongly disagree with @POTUS Trump decision to allow Erdogan to invade Syria. Betrays Kurds, strengthens ISIS and endangers American homeland.
House Democrats must release Volker testimony. Texts show no threats or quid pro quo. Also time for Dems to provide due process, end lynch mob mentality and put up or shut up.
Excellent meeting yesterday with Cub Scouts and parents from St. William the Abbot (Seaford) Troop 690. Terrific kids. Great hope for future. https://t.co/TqJfPvmeeg
More @nytimes hypocrisy and Trump Derangement Syndrome. @POTUS Trump has right and obligation to speak to Australian PM about start of Russia collusion hoax and AG Barr has right to investigate.
The @nypost column by Bob McManus demonstrates the inherent danger of the anti-cop movement in New York. This must end before more cops are killed. https://t.co/UZYjBKKXBh

Congrats to @Mets Star Pete Alonso for hitting 53rd HR to break MLB rookie record. Great player. Great guy. Let’s Go Mets!!
Nothing remotely impeachable in transcript. Ukrainian President brought up Giuliani before @POTUS Trump mentioned Biden. No quid pro quo. Pursuing impeachment is indefensible.
By announcing Impeachment inquiry into @POTUS violating Constitution on word of 3rd party &amp; w/o waiting for call transcript/IG report, @SpeakerPelosi has betrayed an indefensible rush to judgement. As of now, zero basis. Pandering to progressive base. Constitution deserves better
Report of UN officials &amp; parents/admins of UN school outraged by invite to join @FLOTUS @ NYSE show how wacked/hypocritical UN crowd is. Nothing new. School had grieving sessions when @POTUS elected. Should be grieving for countries represented by despots @ UN. God Bless America!
Congrats to @POTUS Trump for supporting ban of flavored e-cigarettes. Positive move against teenage Vaping!
Let us remember today and every day those who were murdered 18 years ago on 9/11/01, those who died attempting to rescue them, and those who are still dying. Never forget. Always remember. God Bless America!!
Just met with British Charge d’Affaires to discuss Brexit. Assured me British Govt will respect Good Friday Agreement and not allow hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Positive meeting.
Met with #FDNY Counterterrorism Unit leaving for Israel to join with with 1200 participants from 52 countries at International Conference vs. terrorism. Proud they are going. Israel is vital ally. Must never drop our guard vs. terrorism. Never have another 9/11. https://t.co/pOpVdv0OE9
Proud to stand with President Trump against abuse of power. https://t.co/SBy89NAaXg
IG Report on Comey leaking government documents and violating law, procedures and guidelines is devastating. Shows Comey’s bias vs. @POTUS Trump. Expect next IG Report on FISA abuse to be even more scathing.
Important that British PM Johnson ensure that any decision on Brexit preserves Good Friday Agreement &amp; guarantees totally open border between N Ireland &amp; Republic. USA played major role in GFA &amp; Peace Process. Too much invested diplomatically &amp; morally to risk return to Troubles.
President Trump’s proposal to purchase Greenland from Denmark should be treated seriously. Would be a strong strategic deterrent against Russian aggression and has vast supplies of natural resources including oil and minerals. https://t.co/im7Csonb20

Good News. White House called last night to tell me @POTUS Trump signed my legislation (H.R. 776) extending Emergency Children’s Medical Program thru 2024 at $22.3 million a year. Vital program. Thanks to House &amp; Senate for passing bill &amp; President Trump for signing into law.

Have great respect for #NYPD Commissioner O’Neill but disagree with decision to terminate Officer Pantaleo. Cops have to make split second decisions. Pantaleo’s decision was understandable under circumstances.

Congratulations to Philadelphia Police. Job well done.
Not being Italian-American I have no idea whether “Fredo” is an ethnic slur. (We Irish have our own problems.) But I support @ChrisCuomo confronting jerk who insults him in public especially when he’s w family. Love that Queens Fighting Spirit Chris! Illegitimi Non Carborundum!
While we hope violence will end in Hong Kong, Americans must make it clear we stand with Hongkongers in their desire for true democracy and freedom.
Terrific meeting in District Office with Diane Costello gun safety advocate from @MomsDemand.

Shameful and irresponsible for @SenBooker to blame @POTUS Trump for El Paso and Dayton mass murders. Just as would be wrong to blame Presidents Clinton and Obama for Columbine or Sandy Hook.
Tragic shootings in El Paso &amp; Dayton demonstrate again the need to address gun violence. Sensible gun regulation is essential as is psychological study of who resorts to gun violence &amp; why/what early indicators there might be. Prayers are w those killed &amp; wounded &amp; their families

9/11 VCF Bill passed Senate. Victory but reminder of who are/will be sick &amp; who will die from 9/11 illness. @SenMikeLee &amp; @RandPaul voted NO. Sen Paul asked why rush. Ask that to families of 18 cops/firefighters who died in last month. Disgraceful dereliction of duty by Sen Paul. https://t.co/BjryE1usiF
This is a great victory, and it’s long overdue. Tremendous credit has to go to all the 9/11 victims and their families who never gave up, and kept coming to Washington to get this done -- and especially with the most debilitating illnesses. https://t.co/nLQGXwVPow
Disgraceful that #NYPD cops are attacked in Manhattan and Brooklyn. This mob mentality must be condemned. Anti-police rhetoric must stop. Stand with Men and Women in Blue!
Headed to Washington, DC this morning. Today is the day for Senate vote for 9/11 Victims Compensation Bill. Justice will finally be done!
Robert Morgenthau. Respected prosecutor. New York legend. R.I.P.
Now that 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund bill is coming to vote in the Senate next week, it must pass w/o further delay. No more games or excuses. Victims have waited too long.
Justice Department decision not to prosecute NYPD Officer Pantaleo in Eric Garner case shows again how wrong it was and is for media &amp; politicians to rush to judgment against Police. No one does more than Men &amp; Women in Blue to protect and save all lives. God Bless America!
Overwhelming passage of 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund in House this afternoon (402-12). Proud to have been a co-sponsor since beginning as well as speak on House floor in support.

Bigoted, hypocritical @nytimes hides anti-Semitism apology on Page 2 of B Section. No details. No transparency. Typical. Like the old days when it covered up the Holocaust. At least it’s consistent.
Disgraceful anti-Semitic cartoon in @nytimes once again displays the shameful essence of this rag. Anti-Catholic. Anti-cop. Anti-Israel. Just the worst. https://t.co/F0CmiAN094
Thoughts and prayers for family members and friends of victims of Poway Synagogue shooting. Disgraceful attack - at any time - particularly hateful on final day of Passover. Justice must be served.
