Their scheme to impeach @realDonaldTrump using the Mueller Report fell apart since it showed no collusion.

So they sunk to grasping at secondhand rumors about a call‚Äîonly to have the transcript reveal there was no crime there either.

If only the Democrats would put this much effort in making America great again.
Nancy Pelosi and her socialist horde in the House cannot accept that Donald Trump won the election in 2016 fair and square. From the Russia hoax, to fake obstruction, to fanning recession fears to calls to world leaders, Democrats are obsessed with impeachment.

Our regional allies are clearly at risk. DOD has been hard at work on countering the Iranian threat, but vulnerabilities remain. Our enemies are building tools to strike remotely and inflict massive economic damage. This isn‚Äôt the last we will see of this threat. 6/6
Iran‚Äôs use of proxy warfare and drone capabilities keeps me up at night. I'm not sure we are prepared for an Iran-backed drone threat to the U.S. or our allies. The attack in Saudi Arabia is a reminder that critical infrastructure is vulnerable. 5/
We‚Äôve seen that drones are no longer the sole domain of nation states. More sophisticated craft are increasingly accessible. They range from toys with cameras to advanced guided weapons. Iran has made progress developing home-grown drones and deploying them in combat. 4/
Everything from small arms to drones flow through Iranian shipping and freight companies. Networks of intelligence officers, shell companies, and ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù businesses prop up Iran‚Äôs fronts for violence and misery. Their network has reach. 3/
Iran has aggressively pursued more advanced drone capabilities and now deploys them in support of the IRGC and its other operations throughout the Middle East. As Iran‚Äôs capabilities mature so will the tools available to its top-tier of proxy actors. 2/
I‚Äôm concerned the attack on a Saudi oil refinery is further evidence of Iran‚Äôs ability &amp; will to use misdirection &amp; attack our interests. Whether the attack was carried out by Iran itself or its proxies, it reflects emerging threats to America &amp; our allies. Here‚Äôs how (thread).1/
