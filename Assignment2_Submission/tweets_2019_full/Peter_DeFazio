It's #InfrastructureWeek, and @ASCETweets has graded OR's infrastructure. All of our infrastructure systems have been rated as either mediocre or poor and at-risk, earning our state an overall C-. As Chairman of the @TransportDems, I'm fighting to make Oregon's systems safer. https://t.co/9YHNj89G7U
For today's hearing on the impact of state-owned enterprises on U.S. bus &amp; rail systems, I wore socks featuring an old-model, U.S.-made bus.

More alarming news: CO2 levels are now at their highest in human history. President Trump and Republicans' continued denial of climate change is having catastrophic effects on the planet and will cause irreversible damage for generations to come. https://t.co/z6fWoeUEJd
I had a great meeting with @EWEButility, a member of the Renewable Hydrogen Alliance, discussing opportunities to reduce carbon emissions by creating hydrogen fuel with surplus hydropower. https://t.co/7J4jHwqgIy
Last fall, Trump allowed states to offer abusive, fake insurance plans—ones that can deny coverage for pre-existing conditions, or refuse to offer coverage for essential benefits. Today, I was proud to support a bill in the House that would prohibit these odious practices. https://t.co/NKHAvekmAb
Today, after I pushed for more funding, a bill increasing stipends for @SeniorCorps volunteers—the 1st since 2009—passed thru a House committee. I helped start the @SeniorCorps program in Lane Cty in 1977.  I'm proud to help these incredible volunteers get the funds they deserve.

The Trump Administration has filed its formal support to gut the #ACA--meaning they support ending coverage for 21 million Americans, raising prices for millions with pre-existing conditions, and throwing young people off their parents’ plans. Outrageous. https://t.co/DtuwsZ8zzM
Climate change is an existential threat and we are already experiencing its disastrous  effects. There is no time to waste. I’m proud to support H.R. 9, the #ClimateActionNow Act, which blocks President Trump from pulling the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement. #ActOnClimate

133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, including 312,000 in OR-04, risk losing their coverage if the ACA were repealed. But Trump keeps threatening to replace it with his ‘secret plan’. This administration needs to recognize that the ACA is here to stay. https://t.co/1y7CH9AXIE
