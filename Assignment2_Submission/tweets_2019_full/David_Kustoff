We all pray for all those who lost their lives in Ohio and Texas as well as their families and give great appreciation to the first responders. These senseless acts of violence have no place in our nation.
This week, I spent two days on the border. I saw firsthand that we have a true humanitarian &amp; security crisis on our hands. To fix this crisis, we need to provide more support to our border agents &amp; build the wall to secure our border once and for all.

I had the honor of joining President of @DiscoveryParkUC, @R_ScottWilliams, for the opening of the park’s new agriculture exhibit. This exhibit will transform people’s understanding of agriculture, giving farmers in Obion County &amp; across America the recognition they deserve. https://t.co/ndc7hhekPb
When disaster strikes, it is critical that people are able to reach their insurance provider immediately. My bill, the CLAIM Act, would ensure in times of disaster, more claims would be addressed &amp; settlements determined in a much more streamlined process. https://t.co/jDYRKoOThv

I sat down w/ @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness to discuss my trip to El Paso's border. I saw for myself the true humanitarian &amp; security crisis at hand.

Speaking with @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness this morning about my trip to the southern border. Tune in!

While on the #Border, I heard from TN troops leading operations at Fort Bliss. Fort Bliss is an essential base for those who serve on the front lines, &amp; it's clear just how vital it is that our military has the correct training &amp; is properly prepared to succeed in their missions. https://t.co/ddMnTYUjxM
After spending my day on the El Paso border, I'm more convinced than ever that our system is overwhelmed. Our border personnel need more resources &amp; protection to properly secure our border. It's time Congress comes together &amp; works w/ @realdonaldtrump to fix the crisis at hand. https://t.co/bUKsPBgZ7H
I am grateful to be in a position to help honor both families and show that our community will never forget these two brave women.

I spoke on the House floor today to urge Speaker Pelosi to bring H.R. 336 to the floor for a full vote. This important bill would take real policy action against the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction movement. https://t.co/Ju3ycFCMMo
Thank you to Johnny Dodson, Eric Maupin, and Alan Meadows with the Tennessee Soybean Association and @ASA_Soybeans for taking time to sit down with me. We had a productive meeting about ways to ensure Tennessee’s soybean industry can continue to thrive. https://t.co/4QQF3I485m
@MariaBartiromo @FoxBusiness Israel is our greatest friend and ally in the Middle East and we must always stand with her if we want peace and democracy in that part of the world.
I sat down w/ @MariaBartiromo on @FoxBusiness to discuss the U.S. relationship w/ Israel. People around the world look to Congress as the voice of America. It's concerning when progressives who represent the face of the Dem party are promoting anti-Semitic measures in the House. https://t.co/g0kbeONAu4
Great day meeting with Mike Powell with the Independent ATM Owners, the @farmcredit, members from @DistilledSpirit and @CraftSpiritsUS, Terry Saltsman, and @TTUPrezPhil. Thank you all for taking time to visit with me up in Washington. https://t.co/K9sEuUzW4m

When our rural communities thrive, the whole country thrives. That is why I joined my colleagues in introducing the Internet Exchange Act. This bill will strengthen Internet access in rural areas by promoting more Internet Exchanges across the country.

@GOPLeader @SteveScalise @RepLeeZeldin @Ilhan It is deeply concerning to hear and see members of Congress on the other side of the aisle advocate pro-BDS measures.
I joined @GOPLeader, @SteveScalise, and @RepLeeZeldin  to denounce Rep. @Ilhan's pro-BDS Resolution. The #BDS movement is a dangerous &amp; anti-Semitic campaign that seeks to delegitimize &amp; economically strangle Israel.

It is more important now than ever to continue the fight against this hateful movement, and the way to do that is with legislation that completely stamps it out.
The passage of this resolution is a first step in fighting back against the #BDS campaign. However, the House must also pass legislation with some teeth. With a rise in anti-Semitism across our nation, Speaker Pelosi should allow a vote on H.R. 336. https://t.co/HzLEItSsFj

Today, I voted against the Raise the Wage Act. Our nation is enjoying the best economy we've seen in decades. Raising the federal #MinimumWage to $15/hour could kill up to 3.7 million American jobs, overturning all of the economic progress we have made.
