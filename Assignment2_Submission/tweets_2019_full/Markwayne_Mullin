I am holding Impeachment Updates in 4 counties to give my constituents a chance to hear what has happened so far, what the process looks like moving forward, &amp; ask questions about the inquiry. Impeaching the president is a serious matter and they deserve to know what is going on.
The impeachment inquiry, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Chairman Adam Schiff, is happening behind closed doors and the American people are being left in the dark.
Time after time, Chairman Adam Schiff has lied to the American people. This week I voted to censure him because we should be able to trust the person leading the impeachment investigation against President Trump. #WeeklyWrapUp

He spread false allegations about Russian collusion, made up a transcript of President Trump‚Äôs phone call with the Ukrainian president and lied about working with the whistleblower. He has abused his power as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee and must be held accountable.
I just voted to condemn and censure Chairman Adam Schiff. Not only is Adam Schiff leading a witch hunt, he has also repeatedly lied to the American people.
Chairman Adam Schiff is conducting the impeachment investigation behind closed doors even though none of the information is classified. The American people deserve to know what‚Äôs happening during the proceedings to impeach our President. It‚Äôs nothing more than a witch hunt. https://t.co/4FUjJGhh0a

The impeachment investigation has always been about politics and never about facts. Chairman Adam Schiff misled the American people on numerous occasions and that‚Äôs why I cosponsored a resolution to condemn his behavior and censure him.
This impeachment inquiry is simply an attempt to undo the 2016 election and it won‚Äôt work.
Our constitutional right to due process applies to every U.S. citizen, including the President of the United States. Pelosi Democrats hate President Trump so much that they are violating his constitutional right in this witch hunt.

FEMA also encourages recipients to keep their receipts for 3 years to show how the funds were spent. After every major disaster, FEMA conducts audits of disaster assistance payments to ensure that taxpayer dollars were properly provided by the agency and appropriately used.
Recipients of grants should use the funds quickly, wisely and only for disaster-related expenses. Disaster grants should not be used for travel, entertainment, regular living expenses or any discretionary expenses not related to the disaster.
Spend your @fema grant wisely! FEMA has approved nearly $12 million in disaster assistance to flooding survivors in Oklahoma.
