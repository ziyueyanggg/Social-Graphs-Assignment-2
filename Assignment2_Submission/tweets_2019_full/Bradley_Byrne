We had a great discussion at today‚Äôs franchise roundtable on pro-worker policies and the challenges these small businesses face. From sponsoring Little League teams to employing millions, franchises are integral to their communities. Thank you Steve Carey and @Franchising411! https://t.co/lCthCdb5d0
Instead of securing our border, fighting high prescription drug prices and strengthening our infrastructure, Democrats are locked in on impeaching President Trump.  When are Democrats going to get to work for the American people? https://t.co/HVxiYK4VzA
The contrast between the agendas of the Democrats and the American people could not be clearer. Pelosi must reject AOC and the Squad‚Äôs radical socialism and promote the health, security and economic well-being of the American people. https://t.co/sAY4HdPVB2
My visit to Israel provided important perspective on my own Christian faith, the importance of our alliance with the only democracy in the Middle East, and the need to challenge growing anti-Semitism and anti-Israel rhetoric at home. Read more here. https://t.co/kocKxC9ONG

Congress should look to strengthen our alliance with the nation of Israel, not destroy it. We must push back against anti-Israel rhetoric, fight anti-Semitism in Congress and the mainstream media, and stop the BDS movement. https://t.co/baRYt11xKK
The University of Mobile has been ranked the #1 Best Small College in Alabama with the #1 Best College Dorms in the state by Niche! This is a well deserved honor. Congratulations, @umobilenews Rams! https://t.co/hHF0eFKRh1
Alabama plays a critical role in our nation‚Äôs military readiness. It was an honor to speak to @AUSAorg at Fort Rucker about my role on the House Armed Services Committee in supporting our Alabama military installations and the men and women of our military.https://t.co/Sla62W6rOn
The Trump administration‚Äôs decision today to eliminate loopholes in our immigration system is the right and humanitarian thing to do. There is much more to be done, but we cannot continue to condone and encourage illegality at our Southern border that fuels the ongoing crisis.

Hospitals are the lifeblood of our communities, but Alabama's have struggled far too long because of an outdated regulation. With @realdonaldtrump's help, we got it fixed. https://t.co/BtPJzfpQJO
Great news for Alabama anglers! The State has reviewed 2019 red snapper catch data and added two more days ‚Äì Aug. 31 and Sep. 1 ‚Äì to the private angler recreational season. State management I've long fought for, instead of federal bureaucracy, continues to benefit the Gulf Coast! https://t.co/VR0SJoA7wG
It was great to be in Grand Bay this morning for a packed town hall meeting!

We had a great day in Huntsville with employees at @CubicCorp discussing their exciting work at the forefront of technology. Their state-of-the-art products facilitate communication on the battlefield, and some of their satellite equipment could even fit into your plane luggage! https://t.co/1OTqHgCOeg
Today is the last day of the extended red snapper season.  With the state now in control, we were able to add five days that had been lost due to bad weather. This is a big victory over federal government bureaucracy that had stifled the Gulf Coast economy for too long!
Outstanding news for our state! This expansion - and the 400 jobs it brings to Mobile - further solidifies Alabama's aerospace leadership. I'm proud Airbus is building American aircraft right here in Southwest Alabama! https://t.co/QrchKlwjiz
Huge news for Alabama hospitals! We've seen far too many rural hospitals close, and fixing the old flawed rule that saw our dollars go to places like New York and Los Angeles is a big win. Thank you to the @realDonaldTrump administration for fixing this! https://t.co/KaCSwbYCcA
Resolution of this dispute is great news for the thousands of United policy holders who rely on the UAB Health System. In Washington, I'll keep fighting for free market solutions to expand treatment options and lower healthcare costs for Alabama's patients.https://t.co/TblfsBqUNa
Congratulations to @ulalaunch for completing the first Vulcan-Centaur qualification unit! With these rockets, Alabama workers are leading the way to ensure our national security in the space domain. Excellent effort by everyone involved!
Preserving the Clotilda is of significant local and national importance, especially to the people of Africatown. We must work together to ensure this part of our history is preserved and protected. https://t.co/TtF6xT5izC
I‚Äôm concerned about the ongoing dispute between United Healthcare and UAB. UAB is a vital source of care across our state. Loss of coverage will affect many Alabamians, and I‚Äôm already hearing from those impacted. I urge both sides to get this resolved as soon as possible.
ICYMI: Our @ICEgov officers need our help at the border! Last week I joined @RepChipRoy and 32 colleagues to ask Speaker Pelosi to keep the House in Washington until we provide ICE the funding they need. Democrats can‚Äôt keep ignoring our border crisis! https://t.co/nI1PUz8uow

Sanctuary cities that harbor suspected criminals - and block federal efforts to apprehend them - should be held accountable.

If you get as many robocalls as I do, you'll be pleased the House voted today 429-3 to pass the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act. This bill will take major steps to end the robocall epidemic. I look forward to working with the Senate to get this bill signed by @realDonaldTrump!
Congratulations to Mark Esper on your confirmation as Secretary of Defense! The @DeptofDefense will benefit greatly from your strong leadership. I look forward to working with you to support our men and women in uniform and protect our national security! @EsperDoD

Great turnout at today's town hall in Prichard!  We are all in agreement - ALDOT must go back to the drawing board and get rid of tolls for the new I-10 bridge.  I'll continue leading the fight to eliminate tolls and to pursue alternative funding for this project. https://t.co/1Q0K0PqZOm
In addition to the absurd $6 toll, it seems ALDOT failed to consider what the ridiculously high toll will mean for other area roads like the Causeway. Just more proof ALDOT must go back to the drawing board to lower the project cost and get rid of tolls. https://t.co/eOi8mUzWxH
Reminder!  Tomorrow I‚Äôll be hosting a town hall in Prichard at 9 a.m.  I look forward to seeing everyone and discussing the many issues facing Southwest Alabama and our nation. https://t.co/Sauby6y1Nh
Instead of government mandates that would kill jobs and depress growth, Congress should be working with President Trump to eliminate wasteful regulations and continue fueling the strong Trump economy. https://t.co/qyz2GBWHex
Talking with Sean Sullivan now about my long-standing opposition to the I-10 bridge toll. Tune in!
As I have said from the start, I‚Äôm opposed to tolling a new bridge over the Mobile River, and ALDOT's revised tolling plan is still unacceptable. South Alabamians cannot shoulder the burden of over $1,000 a year just for commuting to work.
