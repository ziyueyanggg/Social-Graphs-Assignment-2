There is much work left to do to fight the scourge of anti-Semitism and bias-based hate. I am confident that, working together, we will continue to turn our anger towards action.
Beloved by their community, these selfless individuals accounted for 813 collective years of Jewish knowledge, history, and life. Even as a co-chair of the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism, I never thought that I would see the likes of this in my lifetime.
One year ago today, an anti-Semitic gunman opened fire in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and took the lives of 11 innocent souls, for no reason other than because they were Jewish.
