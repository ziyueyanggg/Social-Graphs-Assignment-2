As baseball fans tune in for Game 7 of the World Series tonight, Nancy Pelosi is readying her pitch to Congress on the rules for her sham impeachment inquiry.

Strike 2: No co-equal subpoena authority.
Strike 3: No transparency for the American people. https://t.co/L84hql7sGc

The death of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi is a triumph for the US &amp; a testament to the US special ops forces who risked their lives to accomplish this dangerous mission. ISIS has been decimated in recent yrs &amp; now has lost their leader. @POTUS is right: something very big has happened.
More than 100,000 former miners across the US rely on their UMWA pensions. But, the plan is projected to be insolvent in 2022 if Congress doesn’t act.

Last night, @HouseGOP tried to call for a vote on a resolution to censure Chairman Adam Schiff for lying to the American people. Speaker Pelosi blocked the vote. Democrats say they want transparency &amp; accountability - unless it’s one of their own. Talk about a double standard.
Today, the House will vote on a resolution to censure Chairman Adam Schiff for spreading false accusations and using his position to mislead the American people. I cosponsored this resolution because it's past time he is held accountable. Read the resolution here ↓ https://t.co/RbFTdLpu1R
