If your home was flooded after a certain date, you‚Äôre eligible for federal assistance.

If your home was flooded a week, a day, an hour before it, then you‚Äôre in trouble.

That makes no sense given the reforms passed in the Disaster Recovery Reform Act. https://t.co/Wftce8unuB
We need to streamline and update the way we conduct disaster damage assessments to help folks recover and rebuild faster in the wake of future disasters.
