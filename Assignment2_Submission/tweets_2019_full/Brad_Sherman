Congratulations to @isaaclarian and #MGA for opening a new headquarters in the San Fernando Valley last week, where employees and Valley residents will be able to live, work and play. https://t.co/EKE2c2ll2K
The Trump administration is forcing Planned Parenthood out of the Title X program ‚Äî an assault on access to birth control and reproductive health care, especially for those struggling to make ends meet. Reproductive rights are human rights. #StandWithPP #ProtectX
Pleased to celebrate #IndiaIndependenceDay here at Birmingham High School with the India Association of Los Angeles. https://t.co/0ipswUpUKE
Last week, I marched outside @DignityHealth with @SEIU121RN nurses because they are on the front lines of our health care system.  Adequate staffing is critical for patient safety.
My legal counsel Carolina Krawiec also accompanied me on this visit and can be seen here briefing me.3/3 https://t.co/YURyxy1wRm
This can happen due to a minor legal infraction or even no legal infraction at all (ICE calls it collateral enforcement). We need comprehensive immigration reform now. Will issue a longer statement on our visit soon. 2/3
Just driving back to the Valley with my policy director John Alford. We just visited the ICE Detention Center in Adelanto. It was heartbreaking to talk to people who have lived in California since they were 5 years old and now, 30 years later, face deportation. 1/3
I‚Äôm in Palmdale, 1 hour away from the Adelanto ICE Processing Center. I have grave concerns about ‚Äúfor-profit‚Äù immigration detention facilities.
On the occasion of South Korea's Independence Day, I want to extend my best wishes to all my Korean friends. Our countries share common values and interests, and I look forward to continuing to work with #SouthKorea to promote peace and prosperity.

Even more shameful that he would coerce an ally to thwart Congress in the performance of its Constitutional duties. And even more shameful that he would deliberately undermine support for Israel among a large portion of the US public for his own political gain. #pseudoZionist 2/2
Israel is dedicated to democracy and openness. It has welcomed Muslim government officials from many countries and has tried to get more to visit. It is shameful that @realDonaldTrump would put coercive pressure on a small country less than 2% of our size on such an issue. 1/2

It‚Äôs outrageous enough that Epstein‚Äôs death denied justice to his victims, but how this happened must be accounted for. He attempted suicide 3 weeks ago but was taken off suicide watch just before his death. The Trump @TheJusticeDept must provide answers. https://t.co/hIh7cCsM5F

If the #GOP wins their anti-health care lawsuit, those with preexisting conditions will lose lifesaving protections.

Join us on 8/10/19 as we commemorate this tragedy on its exact date 20 years later at 10:30 am at the Chatsworth U.S. Post Office on 21606 Devonshire St. This event will also be a chance to reflect on the continuing carnage caused by #WhiteSupremacistTerrorism. 2/2
Twenty years ago, the San Fernando Valley was attacked by a white extremist terrorist who attacked the North Valley Jewish Community Center and then killed a Filipino American letter carrier. 1/2
When the President spews white extremist racism, we shouldn‚Äôt be surprised when white extremists feel emboldened. #WhiteSupremacistTerrorism #ElPasoStrong
Our thoughts are with the people of #ElPaso as we wait to learn more about this awful tragedy. This is yet another stark reminder of how senseless #GunViolence plagues our communities. #EndGunViolence
Great meeting with progressive leaders in the San Fernando Valley about the cruel and continuing policy of family-separation at the border, the mistreatment of immigrants in detention facilities, and the need to impeach this President. #indivisible #resist #theresistance https://t.co/kspocCHvRq

While we don't know whether this gunman would've been stopped by pending gun laws, others would have been. That is why the Senate must act on the common-sense gun measures passed by the House. 2/2 #EnoughIsEnough #EndGunViolence
Our thoughts are with the victims and their families who suffered from the horrific shooting in #Gilroy. But thoughts are not enough -- Congress has a responsibility to every family torn apart by gun violence to act. 1/2

The House just voted overwhelmingly to support #Israel and oppose the #BDS movement.  More Democrats voted yes than Republicans. Of course, the House has more Democratic members. 

There was opposition from both parties. De minimis opposition.
